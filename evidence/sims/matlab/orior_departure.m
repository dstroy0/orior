function value = orior_departure(seats, seed, min_occurrences)
% ORIOR_DEPARTURE  How far a sequence sits from a shuffle of itself.
%
%   value = orior_departure(seats)
%   value = orior_departure(seats, seed)
%   value = orior_departure(seats, seed, min_occurrences)
%
%   seats is a vector of symbols, for example double(uint8(text)).
%
%   In the Python reference's recorded figures a memoryless source returns about 1.00 and natural
%   language 0.48 to 0.76; no run of this port prints them. Below 1 means the live sequence is more
%   dispersed than its own shuffle, which is clustering.
%
%   This is a port of the rare half in archive/src/python/engine/analysis/measure/dispersion.py, the tail that
%   evidence/proofs/posits/proof_conservation.py computes too. It computes the same measure and not the
%   same number: the null is a shuffle, drawn here from this language's own generator, and a value agrees
%   with the Python's only as far as the reseeding floor allows. Where the two disagree past that the
%   Python is the reference, because every figure in the ledger came out of it.
%
%   Runs unchanged on Octave.
