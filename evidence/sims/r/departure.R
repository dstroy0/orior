# The permutation null measure, in R.
#
# This is a port of the rare half in archive/src/python/engine/analysis/measure/dispersion.py, the tail that
# evidence/proofs/posits/proof_conservation.py computes too. It computes the same measure and not the same
# number: the null is a shuffle, R draws it from its own generator, and a value agrees with the Python's
# only as far as the reseeding floor allows. Where the two disagree past that the Python is the
# reference, because every figure in the ledger came out of it.

# A symbol is a byte, because the reference reads its corpus with open(path, "rb"). Do not hand this
# the output of utf8ToInt: that is one symbol per codepoint where the reference takes one per UTF-8
# byte, and on any text that is not ASCII the two measure different sequences.
#
# What it measures: how far a sequence sits from a shuffle of itself, read through the gaps between
# repeated symbols. In the Python reference's recorded figures a memoryless source returns about 1.00
# and natural language 0.48 to 0.76; no run of this port prints them. Below 1 means the live sequence
# is more dispersed than its own shuffle, which is clustering.

# Symbols occurring fewer times than this carry no usable gap statistic and are dropped.

#' R's sd() divides by n-1. Python's statistics.pstdev divides by n, and a symbol's spread is the

#' shuffle hold the same count of each symbol, so the same number of gaps, and the factor cancels in
#' every ratio. The floor's sd over seeds is where it would not cancel.
