# The boundary function asked to define itself, and then run over the sets Fefferman's Navier-Stokes
# statement names, with the inheritance of each boundary kind through the constructors checked in the
# engine's exact integer arithmetic. It claims nothing about any open problem. It presents the rigor and
# stops.
#
#   Usage:  python evidence/proofs/posits/proof_boundary_inheritance.py
#
# proof_domain_boundaries.py named three kinds of boundary from a survey and proved each on a case built
# to have it. A survey assigns the kind by judgment, and judgment is what the discipline forbids. Here the
# kind is not assigned. It is read off the object by two probes, and the object answers:
#
#   FORMAT        raising our scale (the format) moves what we reach.
#   COMPLETENESS  raising our horizon (the computation) moves what we reach.
#   MEASUREMENT   there is a gap to the target and neither probe moves it: the floor is not on our side.
#   NONE          there is no gap: the target is reached exactly.
#
# `measurement` therefore means exactly `unmoved by both of our probes`, and from this side `external`
# means the same. The verdict is only as good as the probes: a probe that cannot move an object is not a
# probe of it. That limit is stated here and not hidden. The classifier is run first on four cases whose
# kind is known by construction (the positive controls, from proof_domain_boundaries.py), and only then
# on the Navier-Stokes objects, which come from examples/0_experimental/exact_navier_stokes_on_torus.py
# and are imported from that file so that one representation carries both.
#
# The arithmetic is the engine's alone: Python integers as the bignum, decimal inputs read by
# representation.exact as (numerator, places) pairs, and booleans. Where a value is not a decimal it is
# carried as (numerator, denominator) integers reduced by their common divisor, the same pair with the
# denominator widened, and pi where a decimal report needs it is a scaled integer by Machin's formula.
#
# Their sets, run here: the Taylor coefficients of a solution of (1)-(3) on the unit torus, reported in
# decimals (a coefficient carrying pi has no last digit) and reported in the exact ring (no scale at
# all); an amplitude deposited to six places, a stand-in for a measured datum; and the ratio in which that
# amplitude cancels. Then inheritance: does the constructor chain datum -> u_1 -> u_2 -> u_3 carry each
# kind forward? Measured: the format kind is absent at every order in the ring, and in a decimal report it
# is absent at the rational datum and present from the first derivative on, because the derivative brings
# pi in; the measurement kind is carried to every order and canceled only by a ratio; the completeness
# kind is carried and grows.
#
# The last part is the algebra of one constructor read in the millennium research paper's Navier-Stokes chapter
# (theory/theory/millennium/chapters/chapter_navier_stokes.tex, its account of Corollary 10.6 of the
# 2026 paper it reviews): a periodic field built by summing integer translates of a compactly supported
# one, whose supports stay disjoint. What that constructor inherits from its pieces rests on one exact
# fact, that the bilinear term of a sum splits into the pieces' bilinear terms when supports are disjoint,
# and that fact is shown here on piecewise polynomials with integer coefficients on a lattice of eighths,
# by two routes, with the overlapping case as the drawn null. The construction is theirs; only the
# algebra is run here.
#
# Prior art and language borrowed, named with respect: the problem statement and its numbered conditions
# are Charles Fefferman's (Clay Mathematics Institute, read in full); the probes are the ordinary idea of
# a sensitivity test and are not this work's; the Moore closure and Cantor's diagonal are in proof_set_theory.py with
# their credits; pi by Machin's formula (1706); the fact that a solution's Taylor coefficients follow
# from differentiating the equation at t = 0 is the classical power-series method. No bounding: every
# comparison is an exact equality on integers, on integer pairs, or on sets.
