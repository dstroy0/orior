# Prove it more than one way. Each quantity below is computed by several independent routes, forward and
# backward, upside down and inside out, and they are made to agree to the digit. A result reached by one
# route is a computation; a result four independent routes agree on is checked, in the sense Blum, Luby
# and Rubinfeld gave result checking and David Platt gave his verification of the zeros.
#
#   Usage:  python evidence/proofs/posits/proof_many_routes.py
#
# Four checks:
#   pi          four routes: three arctan formulas (Machin, Euler, Gauss) and the Gauss-Legendre AGM,
#               a different algorithm with no trigonometric series at all.
#   sqrt(2)     three routes: an integer square root, a Newton iteration, and the backward route of
#               squaring the answer to land on 2 exactly.
#   the NTT     forward then inverse returns the input (backward and forward); the forward twice returns
#               the input reversed (upside down); and the transform of a convolution is the product of
#               the transforms (inside out).
#   the CRT     residues then reconstruction return the value (backward and forward), and two independent
#               reconstructions, direct and mixed-radix, agree.
#
# Positive control: within each check the routes agree exactly. Drawn null: one route is perturbed and
# the agreement breaks. The agreement above is a fact. No bounding: exact integers throughout.
