# Proof of the posit that the symbol width has to match the scale of the structure, from the posits
# section of theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python evidence/proofs/posits/proof_symbol_width.py
#
# The posit came from three failures: a Greek text read one byte at a time where its script spends two, a
# vocalization read at 8 kHz where its units run seconds, and a protein read with exact voxel equality
# where its coordinates are real. Each was diagnosed after the fact. The rule is inferred from the
# cases that suggested it.
#
# Proving it needs a domain whose structure sits at one width and no other. One is built here instead
# of found. A vocabulary of fixed width units is emitted with topical clustering. The arrangement is
# real, it lives at the unit width, and nothing was placed at any other. slice at the right width
# should show it and slice at any other should not.
#
# The phase is swept as well. A detector is not told where the units begin, and a slice that is the
# right width at the wrong offset splits every unit across two symbols.
