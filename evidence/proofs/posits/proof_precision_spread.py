# Proof of the precision-spread posit, stated in theory/workbooks/orior/precision_spread_theory.md: an exact
# identity carries full precision from a DEFINED input to its output, and a seed of defined constants
# then generates unboundedly many at the same precision; a MEASURED input keeps its upstream floor and no
# identity raises it, except that a RATIO in which the measured value cancels is exact.
#
#   Usage:  python evidence/proofs/posits/proof_precision_spread.py
#
# The posit came from surveying six domains. Natural constants and hydrogen spectra spread precision
# without bound; crystal edges and physical constants do not, being measured. That is a survey, and a
# rule read off the survey is a hypothesis.
#
# Proving it needs cases where the answer is fixed by construction instead of reported. Four are
# built here from one stand-in constant, pi. A value is either DEFINED (computed to the full scale) or
# MEASURED (the same value truncated to a floor of F places, the rest unknown), and an identity is
# either TRUE or FALSE. The four cases and the outcome each forces:
#
#   defined input, true identity      precision CARRIED to the full scale
#   measured input, true identity     precision FLOORED at F, the identity does not recover the rest
#   measured input, canceling ratio   EXACT, the measured value cancels and the floor is gone
#   any input, false identity         REFUSED by the second-route check
#
# The prediction is exact. Any case that carries past its floor, or floors a defined input, or lets a
# false identity through, refutes the posit. The second claim, that the multiplier is unbounded in the
# defined regime, is counted directly: k defined seeds generate the square root of every k-smooth
# integer, a count with no ceiling.
