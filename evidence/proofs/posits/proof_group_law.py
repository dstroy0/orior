# The rational points on an elliptic curve form an abelian group under the chord-tangent law, proven by
# construction in exact rational arithmetic: closure, identity, inverse, commutativity and associativity
# all hold on a curve carrying both torsion and an infinite-order point, and a law with one sign wrong
# fails associativity. This is the group structure the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is about, the
# exact algebraic side that the congruent-number reading rests on.
#
#   Usage:  python evidence/proofs/posits/proof_group_law.py
#
# It imports the curve and the exact rational from examples/0_experimental/exact_congruent_number.py so
# one representation carries both files, and adds no arithmetic of its own. Python integers are the
# bignum and a rational is a reduced (numerator, denominator) pair of native integers. No float, no
# fraction library, no math library.
#
# The axioms, each on the curve y^2 = x^3 - 25 x (torsion Z/2 x Z/2 at (0,0), (5,0), (-5,0), and the
# infinite-order point (-4, 6)) and the curve y^2 = x^3 + 1 (torsion Z/6 at (2, +-3), (0, +-1), (-1, 0)):
#   closure          P + Q lies on the curve for all pairs tried.
#   identity         P + O = O + P = P, O the point at infinity.
#   inverse          P + (-P) = O, with -P = (x, -y).
#   commutativity    P + Q = Q + P.
#   associativity    (P + Q) + R = P + (Q + R), the one axiom that is not obvious and the one a wrong law
#                    breaks. The classical proof is the Cayley-Bacharach theorem, equivalently
#                    Riemann-Roch on the curve; here it is verified exactly on a sample of triples.
#   Z-module         [m]([n]P) = [mn]P and [m]P + [n]P = [m+n]P, and [-1]P = -P.
#   Nagell-Lutz      a torsion point has integer coordinates. Verified on the two torsion groups, and its
#                    converse is refused: (-4, 6) is integral yet has infinite order, its double already
#                    non-integral; integrality is therefore necessary and not sufficient.
#
# Positive control: every axiom holds exactly on a curve with both torsion and an infinite point. Two
# routes: associativity by the two groupings, and [6]P computed three ways, [2]([3]P), [3]([2]P) and
# [5]P + P. Drawn null: a law with the doubling and chord formula sharing one wrong sign fails
# associativity on a triple the correct law passes, and the false claim that the infinite-order point is
# torsion is refused by [k]P never returning to O. Floor: the axioms are theorems and this verifies the
# implementation realizes them on a finite sample of points, it does not reprove associativity in general.
#
# Prior art, named with respect. The group structure of the rational points is Poincare's (1901), on the
# chord-tangent construction of Diophantus and Fermat; finite generation is Mordell's (1922). The
# associativity is the Cayley-Bacharach theorem, equivalently Riemann-Roch on the genus-one curve. The
# integrality of torsion is Nagell's and Lutz's. Cited from memory of the literature, unread here; the
# file verifies only the exact rational identities. It adds no new mathematics.
