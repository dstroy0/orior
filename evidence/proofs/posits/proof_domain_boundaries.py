# Proof of the boundary posit, stated in theory/workbooks/orior/precision_spread_theory.md section 10: every
# exact representation has a boundary of one of three kinds, a FORMAT boundary that a larger format
# raises, a MEASUREMENT boundary fixed upstream, and a COMPLETENESS boundary that only more computation
# crosses. Arithmetic precision moves the first and never the other two.
#
#   Usage:  python evidence/proofs/posits/proof_domain_boundaries.py
#
# The three kinds are named from a survey of six domains. A survey is not a proof. Three cases are
# built here where the boundary is known by construction.
#
#   FORMAT       the number theoretic transform's length. A length-n root of unity exists modulo a prime
#                p exactly when n divides p - 1. The boundary is the 2-adic order of p. It is proven
#                by building the root at the cap and failing to build it one power of two past the cap,
#                then moving the boundary with a larger prime. The transform is cyclic on Z/nZ, and its
#                double is the involution m -> -m, its own inverse: a format boundary is a fold.
#   MEASUREMENT  a value known only to F places. An identity applied to it lands near F, never at the
#                full scale. Precision on this end does not lower the deposit's floor.
#   COMPLETENESS a bounded enumeration read at a horizon. Carrying the count at more decimal places does
#                not change it; only raising the horizon does. Precision does not buy completeness.
#
# Each case states the outcome its construction forces, and any case that misses it refutes the posit.
# No bounding: every test is an exact integer comparison, and the failures are constructed.
