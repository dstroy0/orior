# The natural constants are computed, not stored, and the check that each is right is two routes agreeing.
# A stored expansion is an oracle, an answer from outside the sample, and a natural
# constant is not that: it is derivable from within to any precision. Here it is derived, and the two
# derivations meeting is the test. This exercises representation/constants/naturals.py at a precision no table would
# carry and shows the agreement, the algebraic identities that give a third independent check where one
# exists, and a wrong series caught.
#
#   Usage:  python evidence/proofs/posits/proof_constants_two_routes.py
#
# Positive control: pi, e, sqrt(2), ln(2) and the golden ratio, each to 2000 places, by two independent
# routes that agree to the digit. pi by Machin and by Euler; e by its Taylor series and by its continued
# fraction; sqrt(2) by integer Newton and by its continued fraction; ln(2) by the 1/(k 2^k) series and by
# 2 artanh(1/3); the golden ratio by the square-root form and by the ratio of Fibonacci numbers.
#
# Third route where an algebraic identity gives one, independent of both series: floor(sqrt(2) * S)^2 lands
# in the unit interval below 2 S^2, and the golden ratio satisfies phi^2 = phi + 1 at the working scale.
# These are derived relations. Each adds a route and holds no stored value.
#
# Drawn null: a Machin identity with one coefficient wrong (16 arctan(1/5) - 3 arctan(1/239) instead of 4)
# is a plausible wrong series. It disagrees with the true value, and the two-route check raises instead
# of returning a wrong digit. A check that cannot fail is not a check; this one fails on the wrong series.
#
# Floor: this verifies the implementation reaches each constant by two routes and refuses a wrong one. It
# does not reprove the classical identities the routes rest on (Machin 1706, Euler, the continued fractions),
# which are named and used without being derived here.
