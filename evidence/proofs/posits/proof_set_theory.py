# The set theory the precision work rests on, proven by construction: the generation operator is a
# Moore closure, and the set of exactly nameable quantities is countable and of measure zero inside the
# uncountable reals. The measurement floor is that boundary, where a physical value falls off the
# countable set into the continuum.
#
#   Usage:  python evidence/proofs/posits/proof_set_theory.py
#
# This claims nothing about any open problem. It proves standard set theory, Cantor's and Turing's,
# reproduced here so the precision document can lean on it. The connection to the engine is one line: a
# quantity the engine carries exactly has a finite description. The exact quantities are countable,
# and a measured quantity is a real the engine can only bracket, since almost every real has no finite
# description at all.
#
# Four parts, each with a positive control and a drawn null:
#   Moore closure    the generation operator is extensive, monotone and idempotent; a single round of
#                    derivation is extensive and monotone but not idempotent, the null.
#   countable        finite descriptions over a finite alphabet enumerate. The nameable quantities
#                    inject into the naturals; the enumeration is shown injective and total on a sample.
#   uncountable      Cantor's diagonal: from any finite table of reals a real is built differing from
#                    every row. No list catches them all.
#   measure zero     a countable set is covered by intervals of total length epsilon for any epsilon.
#                    Its measure is zero; the null is that the whole interval cannot be so covered.
#
# Prior art: Cantor 1891 (the diagonal), Turing 1936 (the computable reals are a countable subset), and
# that the computable reals have measure zero. No bounding: every test is exact integer or rational.
