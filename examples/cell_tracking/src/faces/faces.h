//
// .faces opens with frames, depth, height and width, which are the .points', the .drift's, the .shape's and the
// .links', and then the CRC-64 of the whole .links it was made from, its low word first, as .divide takes it
// (src/divide/divide.h). Each frame follows, in order: its count, and then each point's words in the order of the
// frame's .points: its back-prediction (z, y, x), signed, each written as its two's complement word, then its flags.
//
// The back-prediction mirrors the sort's prediction (sort_link.cu, sort_predict), run backward: a point q of frame
// f > 0 is carried back onto frame f - 1 by the lag the .drift records at f, and by the motion its chosen link out
// q -> q' brought, less the drift then, reversed:
//   b = x_q - lag(f) - (x_q' - x_q - lag(f + 1)).
// With no chosen link out, or at the last frame, b = x_q - lag(f). A point of frame 0 has no frame before it, and its
// back-prediction is its place. The links are the sort's, as the .links holds them: a .divide the output makes after
// changes no word here
