// its back-prediction and its prediction cross) and from the graph every row both files should hold, then holds each

// and view are the .points', each pair record's sources and targets are its frames' points, each chosen link lies
// within them, no point has two chosen links out or two in, each pair's chosen links are its record's count, and both

// it, and each point's back-prediction and flags as this reader rebuilds them from the .points, the .drift's lags, the
// .shape's faces and the sort's links and predictions, before any .divide; each .links outside flag must be its
// prediction's, and the .faces, the .drift and the .shape end at their last frame. A .divide must hold the .points'
// frames and view and the CRC-64 of the .links beside it, and each division, in its parents' order, a parent within
// the frame whose chosen link goes to daughter one, a daughter two within the next frame other than daughter one whose

//   .drift      seven 32-bit words (frames, depth, height, width, three weights), then a frame after another: its
//               positive voxels, and after frame 0 the lag (z, y, x, signed) carrying the frame before onto it and the
//               agreement at that lag
//   .shape      six 32-bit words (frames, depth, height, width, the .points' limbs, and one more), then a frame after
//               another: its count, each point's faces (bit 1 << 2 axis for the low face of axis z, y, x cutting its
//               neighborhood, 2 << 2 axis for the high), then each point's six differences of limbs + 1 words
//   .faces      six 32-bit words (frames, depth, height, width, then the .links' CRC-64 as its low word and its high),

//               8 (the last frame), carried 16 (a point of neither with a chosen link out), then the faces its
//               back-prediction crosses at bit 8, those its .links prediction crosses at bit 16 (none in the last
//               frame), and its .shape faces at bit 24. The links are the sort's, before any .divide
//   .divide     six 32-bit words (frames, depth, height, width, then the .links' CRC-64 as its low word and its high),
//               then for each frame pair its count of divisions and each division's 4 words (the parent in frame t,
//               daughter one, daughter two, and the point of t daughter two's link came from, or 0xFFFFFFFF for none).
//               The CRC-64 is CRC-64/XZ over the whole .links: reflected, the polynomial 0xC96C5795D7870F42, from all
