# Render the object under exam: a deposited backbone and the one a vector walk rebuilds from a
# magnitude table and the Ramachandran cell each residue sits in, laid on the same axes so the
# disagreement is read where it enters.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/proteins/build_protein_view.py 1UBQ
#           python examples/proteins/build_protein_view.py 1UBQ --out build/1ubq_view.html
#
# The engine reads the deposit and walks the rebuild; this writes the numbers into a template as one
# JSON literal and emits a single self-contained page, the same way the blob viewers do. It uses the
# engine. It is an example of the pattern and not a standard-library toolkit viewer.
#
# What the page shows, per unbroken chain run, no run left out and no length window:
#   - the deposited backbone, drawn as muted reference ink,
#   - the rebuilt backbone, superposed onto the deposit and colored by how far each atom lands from
#     where the deposit put it,
#   - the disagreement broken down by constituent: which backbone atom (N, CA, C) carries it.
#
# The rebuild stores only the bond-length magnitudes, the real bond angles, the peptide torsion, and
# each phi and psi quantized to the Richardson two-degree grid. That grid is the reference's quantum,
# named in ramachandran_rules, and it is all the walk is told about direction.
