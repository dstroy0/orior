# Draw a corpus of deposited proteins from the open archive and cache the coordinate files. The
# vector-walk stages have a fixed, repeatable set to read.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/proteins/build_corpus.py [how many]
#
# The draw is the same one the oracle uses: every X-ray protein entry in the Protein Data Bank,
# shuffled by a held seed. A smaller number is a prefix of that shuffle and a larger one extends it.
# A corpus of 10000 contains the oracle's 1000 and every number between. The oracle already cached
# the id list under build/rama; this reads it and never re-asks the search.
#
# The target is a count to reach, not a slice off the top. An id with no PDB-format coordinate file
# is skipped and the next drawn, until the target many are cached. The archive is open and keyless,
# the same RCSB mirror the oracle reads, and the courtesy pause is the oracle's: half a second
# between requests that reach the network, nothing between cache hits.
