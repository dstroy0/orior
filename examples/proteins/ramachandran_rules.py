# The Ramachandran rules, held in one place so the protein stages read them the same way.
#
#   Usage:  from ramachandran_rules import angle, load_contours, region, score
#
# The engine hands back a torsion as exact integer terms and stops there, because the atan2 that
# turns them into a degree is the only irrational step in the path and does not belong in the reader.
# It is taken here, in decimal and to a precision stated below, well under the grid the
# answer is read against. Nothing here imports numpy or any other computing library. Python's own
# integers and decimals do all the arithmetic.
#
# The rules themselves are not this work's. The contour grids are the Top8000 percentile contours
# published by the Richardson laboratory, the same grids MolProbity and the wwPDB validation
# pipeline score a deposit against. They are fetched from the laboratory's public repository and
# cached, exactly as the crystallography oracle fetches a published cell edge from the COD. A
# recovered outlier rate is then checked against a number this work did not produce.

#
# WHAT IS A TOLERANCE HERE AND WHAT IS NOT
#
# Crystallography needs no tolerance: a lattice displacement lands on an occupied place or does not.
# A protein cannot be read that way, and the crystallography README says why. A backbone is a cloud
# of real valued coordinates. A torsion is an irrational the deposit never wrote, and the rules
# are published on a grid of two degrees instead of as a formula. So there is a quantum here, and the
# right move is to declare where it comes from and not pick one.
#
# It comes from the reference. The grid is two degrees because the Richardson laboratory published
# it at two degrees; the favored and allowed cutoffs below are the numbers MolProbity scores with,
# named here and not tuned. The decimal precision the angle is taken to is set far under the
# grid so that it decides nothing. No number in this file was chosen to make a result come out, and
# every stage that uses one reports it.
