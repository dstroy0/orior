# Run the anchor cascade on a protein structure in three dimensions, for Section 4.2 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/proteins/5_sift/protein_domain.py
#
# Section 4.2 holds the invariant over thirteen geometries and dimensions one to eight, and it was
# measured on generated point sets. A protein is that case occurring in nature: an irregular cloud of
# points in three dimensions, each carrying a value.
#
# Projecting it to a sequence would measure the projection. The construction does not need one. A pattern
# here is a set of displacements in three dimensions together with the value expected at each, and an
# alignment survives when every displacement lands on a point holding the value asked for. That is
# Proposition 1 without an order, a raster or an alphabet assumed, the form the propositions were
# stated in.
#
# The null is built by deletion, as everywhere else here, and which property it deletes decides the
# question. Shuffling the values among fixed points deletes composition and keeps geometry, and a
# protein is ordered geometrically. That null cancels the structure. Scattering the points and keeping
# the values deletes geometry instead, and that second null shows it.
