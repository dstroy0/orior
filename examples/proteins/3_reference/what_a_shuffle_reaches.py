# The favored fraction a structure reaches with its phi-psi pairing deleted, built from itself.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/proteins/3_reference/what_a_shuffle_reaches.py
#
# A reference is the most a structure reaches once the thing being looked for is removed from it,
# and made out of the structure alone so it borrows nothing. What stage four reads is the favored
# fraction. The question here is how much of that fraction survives when what carries it is taken
# away, and the answer names what carries it.
#
# Two deletions, each keeping something and destroying something.
#
# Shuffling psi against phi keeps both marginal angle distributions exactly and destroys only which
# psi stood with which phi. If the favored fraction were a property of the two angles separately it
# would survive this untouched. It does not, because the favored regions are diagonal ridges on the
# plane and not a rectangle: a helix is one narrow place and a sheet another, and a phi from the
# helix put beside a psi from the sheet lands between them where the reference is thin. The pairing
# is the secondary structure, and this deletion shows it.
#
# Drawing angles uniformly keeps nothing. It is the flat background, the fraction of the whole plane
# the favored regions cover, and it says how much a reading would get from a structure that had no
# preference at all. The favored regions are a small part of the plane. This floor is low.
#
# Predicted before measuring: the live favored fraction is near total, the paired-shuffle fraction
# is well below it, and the uniform fraction is lower still. The gap from live to shuffle is the
# part of the reading that rests on the pairing, and it is not small.
