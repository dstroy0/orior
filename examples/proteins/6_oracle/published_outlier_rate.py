# Ask the Ramachandran reading for a deposit's outlier rate, against the rate wwPDB published for it,
# over a thousand proteins drawn at random from the open archive.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/proteins/6_oracle/published_outlier_rate.py [how many proteins]
#
# This is the positive control the protein subject did not have. Every control in this work until
# now was a memoryless process, and a memoryless process shows only that an instrument does not
# invent structure. It cannot show that an instrument finds structure that is present, and the
# protein case is where that bit: the crystallography README records that a protein was reported as
# unstructured twice, because nothing here could tell an instrument that stayed silent on real
# structure from one that was working.
#
# Crystallography became the first positive control because a cell edge is published in an open
# database: the Crystallography Open Database gives the edge for every entry, a number somebody else
# measured before this instrument existed. Proteins have the same kind of open archive and a closer
# reference. The worldwide Protein Data Bank is open and keyless, the same way the COD is: the RCSB
# mirror serves every deposited coordinate file and every deposit's validation report to anyone, no
# account and no key. The Richardson laboratory's Ramachandran contours are the rules the wwPDB
# validation pipeline scores against, and it publishes the resulting outlier percentage per entry.
# So both halves of the check are somebody else's: the rules, and the answer.
#
# WHY A RANDOM SAMPLE AND NOT THE BEST STRUCTURES
#
# The corpus is drawn at random from every X-ray protein entry in the archive, with a held seed so
# the draw repeats. Sorting by resolution and taking the top of the list was the wrong control: the
# best-resolved structures nearly all have an outlier rate of zero. An instrument that only ever
# answered zero would have scored full marks against them and taught nothing. A random protein spans
# the whole quality range, from sub-angstrom to the low-resolution end, and carries a real spread of
# published rates from zero to several percent. Reproducing that spread is the test; reproducing a
# column of zeros is not.
#
# The archive is open and the reading takes only what it needs. It never sees where an atom sits,
# only the two backbone torsions of each residue, computed from exact integer coordinates and
# rendered through a single decimal atan2 far under the reference grid. It scores those against the
# published contours, counts the outliers, and compares the count to the published percentage.
#
# WHAT AGREEMENT TO EXPECT, STATED BEFORE THE NUMBERS
#
# Not exact equality on every structure, and the crystallography README says why in advance: a
# crystal displacement lands on an occupied place or it does not, but a protein is a cloud of real
# valued coordinates and its rules are published on a two-degree grid. The quantum is real and it is
# the reference's. So the honest measure is the distribution: how many of the thousand land on the
# published rate exactly, how many within a single residue of it, and every clear miss carried
# forward with the direction it went and the resolution it came from, because a random sample is the
# first corpus here that can say whether disagreement tracks resolution.
