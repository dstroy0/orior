# Two partitions of the same cell, and what each one decides before anything is measured.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/crystallography/2_partition/what_a_grid_costs.py [how many entries]
#
# A partition is the unit and the scale the points are read at, and a reading is undetermined until
# it is fixed. This subject had two of them fixed inside its reader, where neither could be seen.
#
# The grid partition sets a voxel of 0.25 angstroms and caps the tiled side at 320 voxels. The first
# decides the smallest difference the reading can hold. The second decides which cells can be read at
# all, because a dense grid grows as the cube of its side and a large cell will not fit under the cap.
#
# The exact partition sets neither. Points are integers at 1e-1024 angstroms and only the occupied
# places are held. A large cell then costs what its sites cost, and nothing decides a smallest
# difference.
#
# Both arms are swept here against the published edges, and the scale is swept on top of the exact
# arm to show where a scale stops mattering. That sweep is the estimated form of fixing a partition:
# take the value where the answer stops moving. It stops moving early, and the reason is in the
# arithmetic and not in the scale. One multiplication takes a fraction's decimal places plus an
# edge's, which is about eleven, and every scale above that carries the same answer.
#
# That leaves the honest split between the two bounds. The voxel was buying error. The scale
# was buying headroom for paths with more arithmetic in them than this one has.
