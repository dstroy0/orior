# The anchor cascade on a lattice, where the histogram bound should fail hardest.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/crystallography/5_sift/lattice_breaks_the_product_rule.py [entries]
#
# An anchor is a condition copied out of the pattern. Any position genuinely holding the pattern
# satisfies every anchor and correctness cannot turn on which anchors were chosen. The choice
# moves how many false candidates survive, and the usual estimate of that is the product of the
# anchors' own rates: three anchors on elements occurring at half the sites each should leave an
# eighth of the positions standing.
#
# That estimate assumes the anchors are positioned independently. A lattice is the arrangement where
# they are least independent of anything in nature. It is the sharpest available test of how far
# the estimate can be out. src/engine/c/bench/bench_coherence.c measures the same failure on a
# synthetic period. This does it on published cells.
#
# A crystal is the single case here where the cascade needs no tolerance. A protein is a cloud of real
# valued coordinates. Two occurrences of one motif never land on identical offsets and
# examples/proteins/5_sift extends a tolerance of one voxel in each direction to get any match at
# all. Here the points are exact integers and a displacement either lands on an occupied place or
# does not. Proposition 1 is tested in the form it was stated in, with nothing relaxed.
#
# A needle is built from points the arrangement actually contains, near a seed. The pattern is a
# shape the domain holds and not an arbitrary offset into empty space.
