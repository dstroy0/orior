# Find substitutional doping by incidence alone, without reading an occupancy.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/crystallography/4_measure/doping_from_shared_sites.py [entries]
#
# WHAT IS BEING DETECTED
#
# A substitutional dopant is two elements sharing one crystallographic position. That is a
# statement about incidence: two things sitting in the same place. It needs neither distance,
# tolerance nor chemistry, and representation.exact.contested returns exactly it.
#
# No occupancy is read here. The deposit publishes _atom_site_occupancy and that column is the
# answer key. It belongs to stage six and not to this stage. What this measure sees is only
# where the atoms are and what they are. Every other reading in this subject sees that.
#
# ONE CELL, NOT A TILING
#
# Doping is a property of the motif and not of the lattice. A mixed site is written once and
# repeats in every cell. Tiling multiplies the count without adding an observation: entry
# 1000091 has four shared positions, and tiled four times an axis it reports 256 of them, being
# the same four seen sixty four times. Read at one cell the count is the number of shared sites
# the deposit actually published.
#
# That is also the reason doping does not disturb the recovered period. The cell repeats exactly
# whatever it contains, dopant included. The lattice is untouched and the edge comes back
# unchanged. An ideal doped crystal is still perfectly periodic. Stage four's period measure and
# this one are reading two different things out of the same points.
#
# NO CELL IS READ, AND THAT IS NOT AN OPTIMIZATION
#
# This measure does not go through crystal.exact_points, a dependency it has no use for. That path
# errors on any cell that is not right angled, and the minerals that carry doping are overwhelmingly
# monoclinic and triclinic: going through it reads three quarters less corpus and looks like a
# measure failing on three quarters of it.
#
# Two sites share a position when the deposit wrote the same three fractional coordinates twice.
# That is a fact about the atom site loop alone. It needs neither cell edge, angle, tiling nor
# conversion to angstroms. None of those are read. The coordinates are still carried exactly,
# as integers through representation.exact, because a shared position is decided by equality and
# an equality decided on rounded values is not one.
#
# The general lesson is one the subject's README already records twice: reach for the smallest
# reading that answers the question. A measure that asks for more of the pipeline than it needs
# inherits every limit that pipeline has.
#
# WHAT THE READER WOULD DO TO THIS, AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES TODAY
#
# representation.exact.placed keeps the last value at a repeated position. A shared site would
# arrive downstream as one element, chosen by the order the deposit happened to list its rows in.
# Measured on entry 1010929, which puts Cu and Fe on one position: read forward the site is Fe2+,
# read with its rows reversed the same site is Cu2+.
#
# That is a latent hazard and not a live defect, and the distinction is worth stating precisely
# instead of letting the stronger version stand. Two things keep it from biting today. `placed`
# has no callers anywhere in this tree. And `along`, which every period measure here goes through,
# does not overwrite at all: it gathers every value sitting at a coordinate into a sorted tuple. It
# returns the same arrangement whatever order the rows arrive in. That was checked and not
# assumed, on the same entry.
#
# So no published result in this subject is affected. The first reading to
# reach for `placed` on a structure carrying shared positions inherits a silent dependence on file
# order, and nothing in its signature would say so. `contested` is the primitive that declines to
# make that choice during ingestion and hands the question back to the domain, where it belongs.

    from one that is clean.

    WHERE THAT None COMES FROM, AND WHY IT MOVES A REPORTED NUMBER

    None is "no site parsed": the reading is crystal.exact_sites and an entry whose coordinates all
    fail to parse comes back with an empty list and not with rows. A deposit that has rows and no
    usable coordinate is counted unreadable instead of readable with nothing shared.

    An entry nothing could be read from is not an entry that was read and found clean, but it feeds
    the "entries read" figure directly, and the early return does not announce itself at the call
    site. It is the reason this measure and the stage six oracle report slightly different counts of
    shared positions from one corpus: the oracle has no equivalent early return.

    Raises nothing on a malformed coordinate: the site is skipped and counted by the caller. A
    deposit that writes ? for a coordinate is declining to give one, and a site with no position
    cannot share a position with anything.
