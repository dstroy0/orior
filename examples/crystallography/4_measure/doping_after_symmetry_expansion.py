# Doping counted in the whole cell instead of the asymmetric unit, reported by mineral family.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/crystallography/4_measure/doping_after_symmetry_expansion.py [entries]
#
# WHAT THE EXPANSION BUYS, STATED BEFORE THE NUMBER THAT LOOKS BIGGER
#
# A CIF lists the asymmetric unit and the operations that generate the rest of the cell.
# doping_from_shared_sites.py reads the asymmetric unit alone. This reads the cell.
#
# The count rises steeply and almost all of the rise is arithmetic. Over 2853 readable entries the
# shared positions go from 3424 to 20893, about six times as many, and nearly every added position
# is a symmetry copy of a site the asymmetric reading already found.
#
# Almost. Two entries hold a shared position that exists only after expansion, and they are worth
# more than the ratio is.
#
#   1001125   Ta5+ at (1/2, 1/2, 0.238) and W6+ at (1/2, 1/2, -0.238). An operation taking z to -z
#             carries one onto the other. Tantalum and tungsten substitute readily. This is an
#             ordinary solid solution that the asymmetric unit simply does not show.
#
#   1509166   O at (0, 1/2, 0) at full occupancy and Ag at (1/2, 0, 1/2) at half, in I 4/m m m. The
#             I centring carries the first exactly onto the second. The deposit has put an anion
#             and a cation in one orbit summing to one and a half atoms on a site that holds one.
#             That is not chemistry, it is a defect in a published deposit, and nothing short of
#             expansion surfaces it.
#
# So expansion IS a detection, on 2 entries in 2853. It is a poor detector by rate and the right
# tool for the thing it finds, and a reading that only wants to know whether a mineral dopes still
# should not pay for it.
#
# THE COUNT IS 2, AND THE CORPUS SIZE IS PART OF THE CLAIM
#
# 2 of 2853 entries, with the corpus still filling. Not 2 as a settled fact: the count holds for the
# corpus at that size. The measurement is sensitive to two things: corpus size finds the real cases,
# and a parser defect invents others. Anyone quoting this number should quote the corpus with it.
#
# The artifact is the dum sentinel described in crystal.py: an undetermined position written as -1,
# reducing into the cell at the origin, landing on whatever real atom sits there. It surfaces as Mo
# and O sharing a site, which is chemically impossible, and that impossibility is the only thing
# that announces it. crystal.site_table drops the dum rows, and re-reading both published figures
# with them kept and dropped moves no period and flips no agreement.
#
# A THIRD HAS NO DECIMAL,  THIS NEEDED A NEW SCALE
#
# See representation/structure/symmetry.py. A translation of 1/3 is not a decimal at any number of
# places. Carrying an R centered operation through the decimal scale would displace every copy it
# generates. Coordinates here are integers in units of 1/(24 * 10**SCALE_DIGITS), and an operation
# whose denominator does not divide 24 raises instead of rounding. Over this corpus nothing raised:
# 24 held every operation the deposits published.
#
# WHAT A FAMILY IS HERE
#
# The family comes from families.tsv beside the cache, written by utils/maint/data/fetch/fetch_cod_doped.py,
# and it records the search term an entry was fetched under. That is provenance and not chemistry.
# An entry the archive returned for "olivine" that is not an olivine is still filed under olivine,
# because that is how it happened. Entries fetched before families were recorded carry none, and are
# counted separately instead of being guessed at.
