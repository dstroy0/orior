# Check doping found by incidence against the occupancy column that finding never read.

#
# WHAT MAKES THIS AN ORACLE AND NOT A RESTATEMENT
#
# Stage four finds a doped site by incidence: two elements written at the same three fractional
# coordinates. It never opens _atom_site_occupancy. The deposit publishes that column separately,
# and it is a different measurement by the same people: how much of each element sits there.
#
# So there is a prediction to test. If two elements genuinely share one position, the deposit
# should not be claiming both are fully present. Each occupancy should be under 1, and the
# occupancies at that position should sum to about 1, because the site is one site.
#
# If instead a shared position comes back with every occupancy at 1, one of two things is true: the
# detection is wrong, or the deposit is internally inconsistent. Either is worth knowing and
# neither can be seen from one column alone.
#
# A FALSIFIER YOU CANNOT TELL FROM A DEPOSIT DEFECT IS NOT A FALSIFIER YET
#
# This file said for a while that the full occupancy count "would falsify the
# detection", and that was a badly built test. It named a number whose appearance was supposed to
# settle the question, and the number cannot settle it: a shared position with two full occupancies
# is the reading being wrong OR the deposit contradicting itself, and the count is identical either
# way. Stating a falsifier without stating how to tell it from the alternative leaves a test that
# looks decisive and is not.
#
# The repair is to say what distinguishes them, which is reading the deposit. COD 1011256, from
# 1933, writes `Si1 Si4+ 8 d 0.25 0.25 0.875 1.` and `Al1 Al3+ 8 d 0.25 0.25 0.875 1.`: identical
# coordinates, identical Wyckoff letter, both at full occupancy, sixteen atoms on eight places. The
# coordinates being character for character the same is what rules out the reading and leaves the
# deposit. That is an older convention for a disordered site, naming both partners without
# normalizing, and not a substitution this instrument invented.
#
# THE CONVERSE IS THE HALF THAT IS EASY TO MISS
#
# A site published under full occupancy that is NOT shared with anything is a vacancy instead of a
# dopant. Nothing substitutes there; the atom is simply absent some of the time. A detector that
# called every occupancy under 1 a dopant would be wrong on exactly these, and they are more
# numerous than the doped sites. Both counts are reported, because a detector is characterized by
# what it declines as much as by what it finds.
#
# WHOSE TOLERANCE THIS IS
#
# The sum test carries a tolerance and the period measures in this subject do not. The difference
# matters and it is not a softening of the standard. A coordinate is a position and two sites
# either were written at the same one or were not, which is an equality. An occupancy is a measured
# quantity, published rounded, and two of them summing to 0.999 is a deposit reporting a full site
# to the precision it had. The tolerance below is the deposit's own and not this instrument's, and
# it is applied to the deposit's numbers and not to any result computed here. The sum itself is
# computed exactly, as integers.
