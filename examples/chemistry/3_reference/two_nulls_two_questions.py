# Two graded nulls for a molecule, each deleting a different property. The reference fixes the
# question the octet is asked.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/chemistry/3_reference/two_nulls_two_questions.py
#
# A departure is only as good as the background it is read against, and the engine's rule is that the
# background is drawn from the object by deleting one property, never assumed. Two deletions are
# available on a molecule and they are not the same question.
#
# Null one deletes the match between an element and the site it sits on: keep the bond graph and the
# multiset of elements, permute which element sits where. The octet then closes only when each element
# lands on a site whose degree is its valence. The real molecule departs from this null and most
# permutations fail. This is the reading the sift stage rests on.
#
# Null two deletes the connectivity: keep each atom's degree exactly equal to its valence, rewire
# which atoms are joined by drawing a random matching of the bond stubs. Every rewire closes the
# octet, because the octet counts degree and the degree is held fixed by construction. So the octet
# does not depart from this null at all, and the rewires it admits include self-bonded and
# disconnected graphs that are not molecules.
#
# The two answers are the finding. The octet carries information about which element sits where and
# carries none about which atoms are joined. It is a statement about degrees, necessary and not
# sufficient, and for that reason telling one isomer from another is a measure question and not a
# valence question. Both nulls are drawn with the engine's own shuffle; nothing about the disordered
# state is assumed.
