# Valence is a necessary condition on a molecule, and a shuffle of the same atoms loses it.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/chemistry/5_sift/valence_is_a_necessary_condition.py
#
# This is the only chemistry demonstration that runs on the primitives already in the tree. The
# molecule reader and the bond-length oracle are design, stated in theory/theory/chemistry; nothing here
# depends on them. What runs here is the sift proposition read on chemistry: an atom's octet is a
# condition on every atom of an arrangement, a real molecule satisfies all of them at once, and the
# error is one directional. A structure the octet errors cannot be a closed-shell molecule; a
# structure it admits still has to be confirmed, because valence fixes the degree at each atom and
# does not fix which atoms are joined. Ethanol and dimethyl ether both close every atom.
#
# The reading at each atom is boolean. Sum the bond orders on the atom, the electrons it shares, and
# compare against the standard valence of its element: it closes or it does not, with no tolerance,
# because a bond order and a valence are both integers. The molecule is the conjunction.
#
# Two routes are read and they are shown able to disagree. The per-atom octet is the strong one. The
# handshake sum, that the valences add to twice the bond count, is a weaker necessary condition: it
# can pass on an arrangement the per-atom check errors, the mis-wired peroxide below. A
# route that could never disagree with the other would be the same route twice.
#
# The null is drawn instead of assumed. Keep the bond graph and the multiset of elements, and permute which
# element sits at which atom with reference.shuffles.permuted. That deletes one property, the match
# between an element and the degree its place carries, and keeps the counts exactly. Most such
# permutations put an element where its valence does not fit the degree. The octet errors on them.
# The real assignment, the one the elements were dealt, sits above the band the shuffles occupy.
# No distance here is a value; every one is a departure from that band.
