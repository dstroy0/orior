# A single-period reader recovers a constant recurrence and goes blind on a growing one. The
# periodic recurrence along Z therefore needs its shell boundaries supplied from outside.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/chemistry/4_measure/a_single_period_cannot_see_a_growing_one.py
#
# The engine reads a recurrence in two composed steps that already exist. measure.periodicity finds
# the period by scoring a candidate against its own family of multiples, and a sequence that repeats
# every three is read as three and not as six, a trap caught earlier on protein backbones. Then
# reference.periodic builds the maximum entropy background at that one period, binding each position to
# the positions congruent to it modulo the period. Both steps fix a single period: phase is the index
# modulo P, and there is exactly one P.
#
# A periodic property along Z is not one period. The shell lengths are 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, a sequence
# that grows. No single P puts index-modulo-P on the shell closures, and a reader that must find one
# period cannot land on a moving boundary. This example shows that limit on a synthetic sawtooth, a
# property that ramps inside each segment and resets at every segment start. It reuses the engine's own
# sequence_period and the engine's own shuffle, and it writes no element data: the segment lengths here
# are arbitrary and are deliberately not the shell counts, because the real sequence and the real
# boundaries are the atomic-structure ledger's to supply, in representation/atom, and chemistry consumes
# them.
#
# The partition that makes a growing recurrence legible is fixed in one of three ways the engine's
# partition module names. It is not stipulated, a boundary set picked by judgment, the bounding
# this work forbids. It cannot be estimated from the sequence, because a sweep for one period cannot
# recover a growing one, and that attempt is the trap below. It is supervised, ground truth from outside
# the sample, which the partition module places in oracle. So the shell boundaries are the same kind of
# fact as the bond-length oracle, reached from a second direction: the departure is measured, and the
# partition that makes it readable comes from outside.
#
# Two routes are read and shown able to disagree. Route one is the engine's single-period reader, which
# estimates a period and reports how far its best candidate beat the lags outside that candidate's
# family. Route two is a supervised-partition reader, handed the boundaries and asked whether each
# segment repeats the first, the reading that needs the ledger. On a constant recurrence both
# routes depart from the shuffle. On a growing recurrence route one stays inside the shuffle band while
# route two departs. Neither route is the other twice. The null is drawn, never assumed: the same
# values shuffled by reference.shuffles, and the only quantity reported is the distance to that shuffle.
