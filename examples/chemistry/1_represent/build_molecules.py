# Build a molecule as atoms carrying an element and bonds carrying an order, and read what that
# representation fixes and what it leaves open.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/chemistry/1_represent/build_molecules.py
#
# A molecule in the engine's terms is a set of points carrying values: each atom is a point carrying
# its element, and each bond is the vector between two of them. This stage builds the connectivity,
# the atoms and the bonds and their orders. It does not place the atoms in space, because a bond's
# magnitude is its length and a length is an oracle fact, valence-fixed and tabulated, that belongs in
# oracle/chemistry with a citation and is not entered yet. So what is built here is the molecular
# graph, and the geometry it carries is stated as design in theory/theory/chemistry and is not asserted here.
#
# The element identity, the proton count and the electron set, is authored once by the atomic-structure
# subject in representation.atom.element and consumed instead of transcribed. This example holds only
# chemistry's own layer, a valence per element. It runs before that ledger lands on main; wiring the
# import is the routed follow-up. Valence is defined here as the number of covalent bonds a neutral,
# closed-shell atom forms, which for the main group is min(v, 8 - v) over its valence electrons.
#
# The validity gate on the catalog is the octet: every atom of every molecule below must close, or a
# bond was entered wrong. That is the positive control on a hand-built table. The next
# stages rest on the reading it delivers: a formula does not fix a molecule. Ethanol and dimethyl ether
# are both C2H6O and both close every atom. The formula is a necessary label and not the structure,
#  the sift's survivors still need confirming.
