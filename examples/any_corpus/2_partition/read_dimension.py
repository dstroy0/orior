# Recover how many dimensions a set has from a single line drawn through it, for Section 4.2 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/any_corpus/2_partition/read_dimension.py
#
# Reading a set of n dimensions along a curve returns its exponent divided by n, which is only useful to
# someone already holding one of the two numbers. The question here is whether the line carries the
# dimension count on its own, with neither the width nor the exponent supplied and without access to the set.
#
# The first attempt looked for a repeat spaced n doublings apart, sampled eight times per doubling, and
# found nothing at any dimension: every field returned the same period, which was the lowest the search
# allowed and therefore the leftover trend and not a repeat. The reason it found nothing is that it was
# looking for the wrong shape and sampling away the right one.
#
# What the index actually carries is one magnitude per dimension. Interleaving gives bit zero to the first
# axis, bit one to the second, bit n back to the first. A step of exactly two to the k crosses a bit
# belonging to axis k modulo n, and the roughness at that step is that axis's own. There are n such
# magnitudes and they only exist at the exact powers of two, which sampling between them destroys.
#
# So the roughness is read at the powers of two alone, the straight part is subtracted, and the rest
# is sorted into groups by the step's position modulo each candidate count. The count that sorts them
# into the most consistent groups is the answer. Nothing about the field is supplied, and two exponents
# are run at each dimension, which shows up a count that follows the field instead of the set.
