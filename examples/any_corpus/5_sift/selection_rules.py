# Four selection rules on the same needles, and the two columns that are graded differently.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/any_corpus/5_sift/selection_rules.py corpus.sym [more.sym ...]
#
# An anchor is a condition copied out of the needle. A position genuinely holding the needle
# satisfies every anchor whatever chose it. Correctness cannot turn on the rule. The rule moves
# how many false candidates survive, and that is cost. This prints both, and only one of them is
# allowed to move.
#
# The sizing column is the other half. Multiplying the rate of each anchor is correct when the
# anchors refute independently, and rarity chooses, by construction, the symbols least likely to be
# positioned independently: the rare half of a distribution is the half whose occurrences gather
# into passages. A cascade of rare anchors therefore survives more often than the product predicts.
#
# The needle source matters and is swept. A needle cut from the corpus is guaranteed to occur.
# Every search confirms one true occurrence and that hit is not a false positive. The construction
# is specified against a pattern that is unknown and of arbitrary width, and such a pattern is almost
# never present. A needle drawn independently over the same alphabet is the stated problem.
