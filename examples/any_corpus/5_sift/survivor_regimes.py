# Which anchor rule to prefer once the fate of a survivor is fixed.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/any_corpus/5_sift/survivor_regimes.py corpus.sym [more.sym ...]
#
# The workbook leaves the choice between rarity and separation open and names the term it waits on:
# whether survivors are verified and discarded, or buffered and handed on. This file supplies that
# term. A descent that resumes from a parent's survivors, through the resume field of
# AnchorSteerDescent, is the second case: the child reads only what the parent stored.
#
# Discarded, a survivor costs one verification and is gone. The cost is the count of survivors. A
# wrong size estimate costs nothing here, because nothing is allocated from it.
#
# Buffered, the survivors are stored before the next stage reads them, and the store is sized from
# the product rule's prediction. A survivor past the end of the store is dropped. When the dropped
# alignment is a real occurrence, the next stage misses an occurrence the construction guarantees,
# and the failure is one of correctness.
#
# No headroom factor is chosen. A store holds whole slots, ceil(h * predicted) of them, and it holds
# n survivors exactly when h exceeds (n - 1) / predicted. The multiple each rule needs is that bound
# taken over every needle, computed and printed. The table below it steps the store through powers
# of two up to the largest multiple any rule needed, and the verdict reads those numbers.
#
# Controls. A store of zero slots must drop every planted occurrence, which shows the drop count can
# move at all. The discarded regime must drop none, as the filter's soundness requires. Every
# survivor list is taken twice: once by intersecting position sets, once by walking the occurrences
# of one anchor symbol and comparing the other anchors in place. The two routes share no code, and a
# single disagreement fails the run. The null is the same corpus with its bytes shuffled, holding
# every symbol count and removing every arrangement.
#
# NEEDLE, ANCHORS, TRIALS, SEED and the 50000 symbol floor match selection_rules.py beside this file,
# and the survivor and sizing columns compare with its rows directly.
