# One filter, four noises: reject the component the target's invariant does not share, with the
# evidence for every 100% kept beside it.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/sound/4_measure/noise_removed_to_the_bit.py
#
# These are not four filters. They are one construction with four arguments: group the positions an
# invariant makes equivalent, take the value the group agrees on, and the residual is what the group
# could not have predicted. Only the invariant changes.
#
#   coherent hum       the invariant is POSITION   group by phase (period), take the mean
#   incoherent impulse the invariant is a REPEAT   group by phase, take the consensus
#   recurring motif    the invariant is CONTENT    group by surrounding context, take the mean
#   sparse outlier     the invariant is NEARNESS   group by window, take the median
#
# The first section is the sweep: one row per noise type. The WRONG-REFERENCE column is there so the
# matched 100% cannot be read alone -- the same signal through another noise's reference reads near zero
# or below. The method rejected the noise that was present and not the noise it was handed.
#
# The second section keeps the evidence in this file and not in a test, because a floor and a
# divergence probe are not tests of the code, they are the justification for the number beside them; a
# number separated from its basis gets requoted without it. Per method it carries the two independent
# routes and a broken third that must split from them, the drawn null with its spread and not one
#
# THE TWO ROUTES NOW LIVE IN THE PRIMITIVES. Name them here where the example cannot show them:
#   coherent hum        periodic.mean_background        vs mean_background_incremental
#   incoherent impulse  periodic.consensus_majority     vs consensus_median
#   recurring motif     self_similar.similar_background vs similar_background_scanned
#   sparse outlier      windowed.window_median          vs window_median_counted
# A route pair that is real but invisible is one edit from being invisible and gone.
#
# Every figure is exact on a synthetic positive control. Nothing is bounded: periods, radii, window
# sizes and shuffle counts are declared inputs. A native-C route is the natural hardening and is not
# claimed here.
