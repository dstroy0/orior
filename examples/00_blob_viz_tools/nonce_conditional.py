"""At step n, do nonces grouped by their first word's local entropy land in one topological region.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_conditional.py --check     the controls, each able to fail
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_conditional.py             the conditional reading over one header

THE QUESTION

The torsion is high because the local information space is small: one word is thirty-two bits folded
deep, a small change swings the local shape hard. So group the nonces by a LOCAL property, the
entropy of their first state word at round n, and ask whether each group lands in its own region of
the topology. If it does, a cheap local reading of one word predicts where the whole shape sits, which
is a local handle on a global object.

WHAT IS MEASURED

For each nonce at round n: the local entropy of word 0, bucketed, is the grouping variable. The
topological region is the octant the set bits of words 1 through 7 center on, computed WITHOUT word 0
so that a dependence is not word 0 sitting trivially in its own field but word 0's entropy predicting
where the OTHER words land. The mutual information between the group and the region says how much the
one tells about the other, in bits.

THE NULL

Mutual information over finite samples is positive by chance, more so with more buckets. The floor
is drawn instead of derived. Shuffle the region labels against the groups many times and read the mutual
information each shuffle gives. Real dependence clears that band; a value inside it is the estimator's
own bias and not structure.

WHAT IS HELD

Every number here is about the nonce and sits under the fail-closed partition as HELD.
