"""A 16 qubit state simulator in arbitrary precision, on the CPU, using our own constants.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/exact_qubits.py --check
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/exact_qubits.py               a 16 qubit circuit, exactly
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/exact_qubits.py --drift       precision against circuit depth
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/exact_qubits.py --exactgates  which gates cost nothing at all

WHY THE PRECISION WORK PAYS DIRECTLY HERE

Sixteen qubits is 65536 amplitudes, which fits in memory many times over at any precision anybody
would want. So the scarce resource is not space, and the thing a CPU at a thousand digits can do
that no float64 simulator can is be RIGHT: every published state vector simulator carries float64
amplitudes and therefore a floor near 1e-16 that grows with circuit depth.

AND THE GATE SET SPLITS THE SAME WAY EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS TREE SPLITS

    X, Z, CZ, CNOT, S      sign flips, swaps and multiplication by a power of i.
                           NO ARITHMETIC AT ALL. They are EXACT at every precision and add
                           nothing to any error, ever.
    H, and rotations       need 1/sqrt(2) or a trigonometric value, which is irrational. These
                           are where precision enters and the only place it does.

That is the same boundary as the four exact nulls in `deform_rate.py`: a move that is a relabeling
of numbers already held is exact because there is nothing in it to round. A Clifford circuit built
from the first row runs with zero error at any width, which is a stronger statement than "high
precision" and is checked below and not asserted.

OUR OWN CONSTANTS AND NO FALLBACK

The Hadamard's 1/sqrt(2) comes from `dn_const/dn_constants.csv`, where root_two is held to a
thousand places and agreed by two routes. `math.sqrt(2)` is a double and would cap the whole
simulator at sixteen digits through one number. The constants table exists to prevent that failure.
