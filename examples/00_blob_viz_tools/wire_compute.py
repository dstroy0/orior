WHAT THIS ANSWERS

"So, you think we cant just read entropy in and demonstrate it computing?"

This demonstrates it. What the representation can HOLD is the wrong question for a machine. Graph states are the resource for MEASUREMENT
BASED computation: you do not apply gates to them, you prepare the graph and compute by measuring
qubits in chosen bases. The measurement pattern is the program.

ON A 1D CHAIN THE PATTERN IS A WIRE, AND THE WIRE DOES NOT COST ONE SITE PER MEASUREMENT.
Measuring site after site in the X basis does not walk the logical state along the chain. Measuring the END of a chain in the X basis
DISENTANGLES ITS NEIGHBOR. Each such measurement consumes TWO sites, and the edge count falls
by 2 then 0 in alternation and not by 1 each step.

That is not a bug in the composition and it took a real test to establish which of the two it was.
The stabilizer argument settles it by hand: for the path 0-1-2-3 the generators are X0 Z1, Z0 X1 Z2,
Z1 X2 Z3, Z2 X3, and measuring X0 removes the one generator that anticommutes with it, Z0 X1 Z2,
leaving Z1, X2 Z3 and Z2 X3 on the remaining qubits. Z1 stabilizes qubit 1 ON ITS OWN. Qubit 1 is
left in a product state while the edge 2-3 survives. The neighbor really is disentangled.

SO THE X MEASUREMENT IS EXACT AND "MEASURE X LEFT TO RIGHT" IS NOT A PROPAGATING WIRE. Those are
separate claims and only the first one holds. The one-way model's wire propagates using measurement
angles in the X-Y plane, and the Pauli-basis special case measured here consumes the chain instead
of walking along it. What this file demonstrates is therefore exact Clifford measurement on the 1D
map, not a logical state walking to the far end.

THE THREE MEASUREMENT RULES ON A GRAPH STATE, all exact on the bits with no arithmetic:

    Z at a      delete a and every edge on it
    Y at a      local complement at a, then delete a
    X at a      pick a neighbor b, local complement at b, Y-measure a, local complement at b

snap_release.py already carries Z and Y under the names release and switch. X is composed here from
the same two pieces, and so it is exact for the same reason they are.

THE CLAIM AND ITS BOUNDS

This computes. It computes the Clifford part of the one-way model, exactly, at a scale a state
vector cannot reach, and that part is not idle: stabilizer codes, syndrome extraction, entanglement
routing and teleportation all live there. It is also classically simulable, by Gottesman-Knill, and
that is not a contradiction. A pattern whose measurement angles leave the Pauli bases is where
universality begins and where this representation stops, and the cost of that step is counted in T
gates and not in qubits or in entanglement.

THE CORRECTION THIS FILE CARRIES. An earlier document in this tree said the exponential lives in
the entanglement. It does not. A perfect matching across a cut of 4096 qubits holds 2048 bits of
entanglement in 1 MB, verified against the real state vector at every width where that is
computable. Entanglement is cheap. Magic is not.
