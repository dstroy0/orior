WHAT THIS DRAWS

A reading to degree L is a linear map from a weight per interior source to (L+1)^2 boundary
coefficients. Take its singular value decomposition. The right singular vectors are directions in
*source* space, ordered by how strongly the boundary answers them, and the ones past the rank
answer with exactly nothing.

So the page puts two equal-area maps of the same sphere side by side. On the left, the source
weights of one singular direction. On the right, the boundary field those weights produce. Step
through the directions and the left map stays vivid while the right map goes flat.

Delta Null theory in one picture: a change to the object, and a boundary with nothing to
say about it. Not a faint reading. Nothing.

WHY A PROJECTION INSTEAD OF A BALL

A sphere drawn as a ball hides half of itself and makes a reader turn it to be sure they have seen
everything. A blind direction has to be shown entire, or the picture invites the suspicion that the
missing signal was simply round the back. Mollweide is equal-area, and a patch's size on the page is
its solid angle, and no part of the sphere is hidden or magnified.

WHAT IS EXACT AND WHAT IS NOT

The matrix, its decomposition, and the residual norms are computed at full depth with no smoothing, the
most favorable case there is: both kernels are diagonal in degree and below one. Either can
only shrink a singular value. The field maps are drawn on a finite grid and are a picture; the
numbers printed beside them are the measurement.
