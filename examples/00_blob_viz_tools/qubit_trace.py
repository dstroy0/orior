WHY THE HARMONIC READING IS THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT FOR THIS, AND THE BEAMS ARE NOT

A quantum state is a vector of COMPLEX amplitudes. The harmonic rows carry complex coefficients
whose phase is what torsion reads. They hold amplitude. The beam rows are real and
non-negative. They hold intensity and would throw the phase away. For a state vector the
harmonics are the instrument and the beams are the wrong tool, the reverse of the bit
pattern case.

THE SIZES LINE UP EXACTLY AND THAT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE WORTH HIDING

Eight qubits is 256 amplitudes. The placement carries 256 sources. A degree 16 reading has 289
coefficients and rank 256, measured in conserved.py. So the reading is COMPLETE for an eight qubit
state: every amplitude is recoverable, and nothing about the state sits in a kernel.

THE PREDICTION THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN TO TEST, AND IT FAILED

The prediction was that Grover's iteration, being a rotation, would show a large rigid component in
the deformation scalar, against SHA-256's tail bit which showed none. IT DID NOT. The scalar reads
1.0000 at every Grover step, indistinguishable from the avalanche.

THE REASON IS STRUCTURAL AND WORTH MORE THAN THE PREDICTION WAS. The only rigid motion divided out
here is a GLOBAL PHASE, the right invariance for physical indistinguishability and is not
the motion Grover performs. Grover rotates inside the two dimensional span of the marked state and
everything else, and the identity of that subspace depends on the marked item. So dividing it out
requires already knowing the answer, the thing being searched for. A quotient that needs
the answer is not an instrument.

WHAT ACTUALLY SEPARATES THEM IS THE MAGNITUDE, NOT THE DIRECTION

Everything here is supposed to be a magnitude and a vector. That is the resolution. The
step NORM carries the rotation signature that the direction quotient cannot:

    a rotation at fixed angular rate takes fixed size steps, and reverses at the turning point
    an avalanche takes steps of no fixed size at all

Measured: Grover's step norm holds within about six percent across seventeen iterations and has a
clean minimum at the optimum, where the over-rotation begins. SHA-256's tail bit moves over an
order of magnitude between consecutive rounds. So the separator is the CONSTANCY of the magnitude,
reported by `--compare` as a coefficient of variation, and the scalar is the wrong column for this
question. It was the right column for the deformation work , and for that reason it was reached for.

WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED

This simulates a quantum computer and does not use one. The cost is 2^n complex amplitudes, which is
16 KB at ten qubits and 500 MB at twenty five. The method is bounded to small circuits by
counting and not by engineering. Nothing here is a route to more qubits than memory holds, and the
compressible states are the nearly classical ones that carry no advantage.

    The claim: incoherent information need not be held stable here, because it is coherent
    elsewhere, and for that reason qubits resist being expressed.

    The physics half of that is right and is testable in one table. Decoherence is not destruction,
    it is DELOCALIZATION: the global state stays pure and unitary while the local one goes mixed,
    and the local one goes mixed only because the environment was traced out. So the question
    "where did the coherence go" has an exact answer and it is "into the correlations", which is a
    subspace the local instrument does not span.

    THAT IS THE SAME SHAPE AS THE KERNEL RESULT MEASURED IN conserved.py. A vector invisible to a
    degree 8 reading read 2.7376e-02 at degree 16: unread and not destroyed. Here the narrow
    instrument is the partial trace and the wider one is the whole state.
