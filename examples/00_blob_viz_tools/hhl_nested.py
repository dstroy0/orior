"""HHL against a classical solve on nested qubit topology, and where the crossover actually sits.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/hhl_nested.py                 the scaling, 1D through 4D
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/hhl_nested.py --crossover     where quantum starts winning, per dimension

WHAT THIS SETTLES

The claims: "hhl will work on the 1d map of qubits", and "now you can nest extra dimensional
topology and the algebraic expression pays."

Both are right, and the objection to them aims at the wrong matrix: the 256 x 256 boundary reading
map in conserved.py, which is nearly dense, has a measured conditioning of 55 to 138, and needs its
whole solution vector read out. On that matrix HHL is hopeless.

A NESTED QUBIT MAP IS A DIFFERENT OBJECT AND IT HAS EXACTLY THE TWO PROPERTIES HHL NEEDS.

    SPARSE       a d-dimensional grid Laplacian has 2d + 1 nonzeros a row, whatever N is
    LARGE        the graph-state representation holds 4096 qubits in 1 MB and a million in 8 MB

and the third property, the one that decides it, is the condition number.

THE DIAGONAL IS THE WHOLE ARGUMENT

A connected graph's Laplacian is SINGULAR: the all-ones vector sits in its kernel. Kappa is
infinite and no iterative or quantum method has a bound. Add a diagonal term m and the spectrum
moves from [0, 4d] to [m, 4d + m], so

    kappa = (4d + m) / m = 1 + 4d / m

which is CONSTANT IN N. That is the counterintuitive part: making the system bigger does not make it
harder to solve, only wider. And the diagonal term is not an invention for this file. It is the
fourth term: a per-qubit entanglement magnitude is a diagonal contribution to the operator. The
4-term specification and HHL's applicability are the same fact.

THE CLASSICAL BASELINE IS CONJUGATE GRADIENT AND NOT A DIRECT SOLVE

This matters as much as the quantum side and it is where a comparison like this usually cheats.
Quoting O(N^3) dense LU, or even nested dissection at O(N^(3(d-1)/d)), would hand HHL a win it has
not earned: nobody solves a sparse well-conditioned system that way. Conjugate gradient converges
in O(sqrt(kappa)) iterations at O(N s) each. The honest classical cost is

    classical    O(N * s * sqrt(kappa))
    HHL          O(log(N) * s^2 * kappa^2 / epsilon)

Both degrade with dimension. The difference that survives nesting is the N term: linear against
logarithmic. "The algebraic expression pays" means that here, and it is the only asymptotic
quantum win anywhere in this tree.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM

HHL returns the solution as a quantum state. It yields scalar functionals of x and not the N
components of x. Reading out every component costs O(N) measurements and spends the speedup exactly.
For a nested map where the wanted answer is one correlation or one expectation value, that is no
obstruction. For the whole vector it is fatal. Every row below assumes a scalar readout.

Constants are dropped on both sides. These are scalings and not wall clock.
