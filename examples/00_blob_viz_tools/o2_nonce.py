"""The recursive spawn pointed at the nonce, counting hashes against a plain scan.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/o2_nonce.py --check          the controls, each able to fail
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/o2_nonce.py                  the measurement table over a real header
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/o2_nonce.py --bits 20        search a 2^20 window instead of the default set

WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHY A TIE IS THE HONEST ANSWER

A nonce is a winner when the header's double SHA-256 carrying it comes in under the target. The only
way to read anything about a nonce's digest is to compute it: SHA offers no cheaper necessary
condition than the hash itself. So the FIRST question the recursion asks has to hash every candidate,
and once it has, the digest is cached and every later question is free. The hashes a run spends is
therefore the number of distinct candidates hashed, which the first question drives to the whole
window. That equals a plain scan. The recursion adds structure and no saving. The count shows it, and
not the claim being asserted.

WHERE A SAVING COULD COME FROM, AND THE HOOK THAT WOULD SHOW IT

A saving needs a necessary condition that is CHEAPER than a full hash and that a real winner always
passes. `--cheap` names one, evaluated without hashing, asked as the first question so only the
candidates it keeps are ever hashed. If it prunes, the hash count drops below the scan and the ratio
prints under one. If it is not actually necessary and drops the true winner, the positive control
below fails, and the run reports the condition unsound instead of crediting it with a saving. That is
the safety: a cheap condition earns a saving only by keeping every winner, and the known nonce is the
witness.

THE POSITIVE CONTROL

The header is a real block whose winning nonce the chain recorded. The search hides the low bits of
that nonce and looks for it in the window around it. A run is believed only when it returns exactly
that nonce and the nonce reproduces the block's own id. A cheap condition that breaks this is
reported instead of trusted.

WHAT IS HELD

Every number here is about the nonce and sits under the fail-closed partition as HELD.
