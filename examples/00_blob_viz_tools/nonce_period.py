"""Does the nonce to hash map have a period? The one question that decides whether Shor applies.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_period.py --check
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_period.py               the probe, against a matched null
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_period.py --resources   what a real Shor run would need

WHY THIS IS THE COHERENT FORM OF THE REQUEST

Asked for: implement Shor's algorithm into the miner.

Shor's algorithm finds the PERIOD of a function. It works by preparing a superposition over the
domain, applying the function, and letting the Fourier transform peak on the periodicity.
`shor_trace.py` shows it: peaks at 0, 4, 8 and 12 because 7^x mod 15 has period 4, and
two controlled steps moving nothing at all because 7^4 mod 15 closes the orbit.

So Shor is not a search accelerator. It is a period finder, and it returns nothing useful when
handed a function with no period. Wiring it into a nonce search would be wiring a resonator to a
signal that does not oscillate.

THE QUESTION THAT ACTUALLY DECIDES IT, AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN MEASURED HERE

Does the nonce to hash map have a period? If it does, Shor becomes relevant and everything changes.
If it does not, Shor cannot help and that is settled and not assumed.

This tree's standing constraint is that no projection over the digest reduces the number of
evaluations, graded across twenty hypotheses. But PERIODICITY specifically was never tested. The
claim rests on an argument and not on a measurement. This file measures it.

HOW, AND WHY IT IS CLASSICAL

A period of the full 256 bit hash cannot exist in any useful sense, because the map is injective on
32 bit nonces with overwhelming probability. So the test is on a REDUCTION: f(n) = hash(n) mod M for
a small modulus, which has a small codomain and could genuinely repeat. Shor would find a period of
that reduction if one existed. Finding none classically settles the question without needing the
quantum machine at all.

And the classical test is strictly stronger than a simulated quantum one here. Simulated Shor over a
32 bit domain needs 2^67 amplitudes. Direct period detection needs a table.

    "If it's sqrt do the dimensional 2s comp, you have n dimensions."

    The reasoning is sound and it is the right question to ask of a square root. If the space
    factors into d independent dimensions, and each can be searched on its own, then Grover costs
    d * sqrt(N^(1/d)) = d * N^(1/2d) instead of sqrt(N). That is not a small improvement. It
    collapses the exponent, and the table below shows by how much.

    THE ARITHMETIC IS RIGHT AND THE PREMISE IS WHAT FAILS. Searching one dimension on its own
    requires an oracle that can say THIS DIMENSION IS CORRECT while the others are still wrong.
    That is partial credit, and a hash function is built specifically to destroy it: every input bit
    reaches every output bit. No projection of the input is separately verifiable.

    FOUR INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENTS IN THIS TREE SAY THERE IS NO PARTIAL CREDIT, and they used
    different instruments, and so they are worth listing and not summarizing:

        nonce_read.py       a boundary reading of an early state against the final digest. Null,
                            with a drawn null over 200 shuffles.
        beam_read.py        the same question with 256 directional line integrals, which add 175
                            dimensions of rank the region reading does not have. Null at every live
                            round, weakest limit 0.100, with the round 64 positive control firing.
        qubit_trace --invert    a PARTIAL inversion returns zero at best and a loss at worst.
        qubit_trace --nested    nesting to depth d costs reach b^d and gives no partial credit on
                            the way.

    AND A THEOREM SAYS IT CANNOT BE FIXED BY CLEVERNESS. The BBBV bound proves Omega(sqrt(N)) is
    optimal for a black box oracle, and any scheme that beats sqrt(N) must be exploiting structure.
    The dimensional split beats it by a wide margin, and for that reason it needs the structure
    that four measurements here do not find. QUOTED and not verified here.
