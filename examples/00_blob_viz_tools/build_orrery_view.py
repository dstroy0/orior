    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/build_orrery_view.py --bodies 6 --frames 512 --mode shadow

  --bodies    how many orbiting bodies. Default 6.
  --frames    how many steps of the clock to precompute. Default 512.
  --mode      glow for a scattering ball, shadow for a clear one. Default glow.
  --degrees   highest harmonic degree carried. Default 48.
  --tau       conduction time the surface is left to smooth for. Default 0.0006.
  --seed      draw for the sizes and phases. Default 11.
  --out       where to write. Default: orrery_view.html in build/view, through out_path.

WHY A SYSTEM AND NOT A FILE

Everything else in this directory reads data nobody knows the shape of, and a viewer that
looks right is impossible to grade. Here the interior is written down first: bodies at known radii on
known periods. The page then shows the boundary alone, derives the interior back out of it, and
prints the derived numbers next to the ones it was built from. A viewer that draws a convincing
picture and recovers the wrong radius is caught in the same glance.

TWO WAYS FOR THE INSIDE TO REACH THE OUTSIDE

    glow    the medium scatters without limit, transport is diffusion, and a body at radius r
            reaches degree l as (r/R)^l. Depth sets how wide a patch the body can print, and a body
            near the center is a broad warmth and one near the shell is a small bright spot. There
            are no shadows in this limit at all: light that has forgotten its direction cannot
            leave one behind.

    shadow  the medium is clear, transport is ballistic, and a beam from outside prints the
            silhouette of whatever it passes. Edges are as sharp as the bodies are, and a body that
            emits nothing is as visible as one that emits everything.

Those are the two limits of one transport equation and the page carries both, because they fail in
opposite directions. Diffusion sees what is bright and loses where it is. Ballistics sees where
something is and loses what it was. Shining a very bright light through a scattering ball is the
attempt to read the ballistic part before scattering buries it, and the page prints the attenuation
that attempt has to survive.

TIME IS THE INTERIOR MOVING WHILE THE BOUNDARY HOLDS STILL

The boundary never moves here. The bodies do, and the surface changes because of it. So the clock
is not supplied from outside: it is read off a fixed surface, and a run where the observer also
moves can be told apart from a run where it does not by holding the observer still and watching
whether anything keeps changing.

WHAT IS DERIVED

A single patch of the boundary is watched over the whole run, giving one number per step. Each body
crossing the line between the source and that patch prints a dip. The dips repeat on that body's
period, the period gives the radius by Kepler's third law, and the recovered radius is printed
beside the radius the body was built with. Nothing about the recovery reads the body table.
