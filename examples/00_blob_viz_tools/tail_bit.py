"""One bit flipped at the tail of a message, read as a deforming surface, round by round.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/tail_bit.py                  the onset and what follows it

THE EXPERIMENT

Inject a one at the very tail of the message, right before the padding closes it, and watch the
surface. The state is read as a lit set on a boundary and the quantity reported is the deformation
scalar from `deform_rate`: the fraction of the reading's change that no rigid rotation explains.

WHY THE SCHEDULE MAKES THIS A CLEAN MEASUREMENT AND NOT A PICTURE

The flipped bit sits in schedule word 13, and round r consumes word r. So rounds 0 through 12 cannot
have seen it, and the first fourteen states must be BIT-IDENTICAL between the two messages. That is
a free exact null sitting in front of the experiment: if any of those rounds shows a nonzero
reading, the instrument is broken and nothing after it counts. The onset is therefore predicted and
not discovered, and the interesting question is only what the onset looks like and how long it
lasts.

Three regimes are expected, and the middle one is the only place a claim about revealing anything
could live:

    rounds 0 to 12     identical, exactly. The bit has not arrived.
    the onset          a few bits differ. The deformation is partial and localized.
    after saturation   half the bits differ. The deformation is total and carries no structure.

WHAT THIS TREE HAS ALREADY FOUND, STATED BEFORE THE RUN

The transform workbook's hypotheses came back null: survivor counts track the cost model exactly,
no bit or byte position departs from flat, and no projection over the digest reduces the number of
evaluations at all. The avalanche is designed to erase. So the honest prior is that the surface
deforms completely and reveals nothing, and the measurement worth having is the WIDTH of the onset
window, because that is the only interval in which the deformation is not yet total.

A large deformation is not a revelation. Saturation and structure look identical in any single
number, and so the round count and the Hamming distance are printed beside the scalar.
