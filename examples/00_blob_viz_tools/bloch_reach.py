THE QUESTION, AND IT HAS AN EXACT ANSWER

"Prove that we can reach all points on a Bloch sphere, record the graph pts."

The answer is no for the graph form and it is not a vague no. A single-qubit STABILIZER state is an
eigenstate of a Pauli operator, and there are exactly six of them:

    |0>, |1>            the Z eigenstates, the poles
    |+>, |->            the X eigenstates
    |+i>, |-i>          the Y eigenstates

Those six points are the vertices of a REGULAR OCTAHEDRON inscribed in the Bloch sphere. Not a
dense set, not an approximation to the sphere: six points. The single-qubit Clifford group has 24
elements and it PERMUTES those six. No amount of Clifford work reaches a seventh.

A graph state on one vertex with no edges is |+>, one of the six. Its local Clifford orbit is all
six. So the graph points are recorded below and there are six of them.

HOW FAR SHORT IS THAT, IN A NUMBER

The right measure is the COVERING RADIUS: the largest angle from any point of the sphere to the
nearest reachable point. For the octahedron that angle is exact and it is worth having in closed
form, because it says how wrong the stabilizer set can be about a state:

    the worst-case point is a face center, at (1,1,1)/sqrt(3)
    its angle to the nearest vertex is arccos(1/sqrt(3)) = 54.7356 degrees

a stabilizer state can be wrong about a qubit's direction by nearly fifty-five degrees. That is
the honest size of the gap and it is why the graph form cannot be sold as reaching the sphere.

WHAT CLOSES IT, AND THAT WE HAVE IT

T gates. tgate_free.py proves the T gate is applied exactly here at no cost beyond the working
precision, because exp(i pi/4) = (1+i)/sqrt(2) and sqrt(2) sits in dn_constants.csv at a thousand
places with a zero gap. Clifford plus T is universal. The reachable set becomes DENSE in the
sphere and the covering radius falls with depth.

DENSE IS STILL NOT ALL, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE HONEST ANSWER. A finite gate set applied
finitely many times reaches a countable set of points, and the sphere is uncountable, a measure
zero subset is the most any gate set reaches. The claim that survives is: arbitrarily close to any
point, exactly, with the error falling as depth grows and each gate costing nothing to apply.
