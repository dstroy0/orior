WHAT THIS IS FOR

"If we have the null permutation from the start, that's the demon."

On the demon's position: "just because laplaces demon knows everything, doesnt mean he can act on
the information, he can just tell us about it, we are the ones asking questions and adjudicating."

A null earned the expensive way runs the instrument, fades an injected signal until it disappears,
and reports the level at which it vanished. That gives a detection limit
and it is honest, but it is a measurement of the instrument's blindness discovered by experiment.

THE KERNEL DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DISCOVERED. It is a property of the reading map, alone.
Rank-nullity gives its dimension before any object is chosen, an SVD gives an explicit basis for
it, and every vector in that basis IS a null permutation: a change to the object that the reading
cannot see, exactly, by construction and not below a threshold.

That is the demon's position and it is available for free. Knowing it changes what a null means:

    WITHOUT the kernel   "we looked and found nothing" and the reader supplies the caveat
    WITH the kernel      "we looked and found nothing, and here are the K dimensions in which
                          finding nothing was guaranteed before we started"

THREE BLIND SPOTS THIS PREDICTS

    the harmonic reading at degree 8 over 256 sources is blind in 175 dimensions. Derivable
        from 256 - 81 in one line.
    the twist leaves entanglement exactly unchanged. Derivable from local Clifford invariance.
    the conditioning bound is blind to field placement. Derivable from the bound reading only
        min and max.

None of those needs an experiment to know.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO

A derived kernel says what CANNOT be seen. It says nothing about what can: a direction outside the
kernel may still be invisible in practice because the instrument is ill-conditioned there, and that
part is genuinely empirical. So this narrows the empirical work instead of replacing it, and the
injection-fade limit is still the right tool for everything outside the kernel.
