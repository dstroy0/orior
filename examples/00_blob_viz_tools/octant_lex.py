"""Lexes SHA-256's morphing boundary into a language: eight octant letters, round by round.

WHAT THIS READS

Space splits into eight octants sharing one trilateral right-angle corner at the origin, and on the
boundary that split cuts eight congruent spherical triangles of area pi/2 each. A state of the
object writes one letter in each octant, the letter being what share of the lit set sits there, and
a round rewrites all eight at once. The eight numbers tracked across the rounds are the word the
computation defines, and this prints it.

Three things come out of the reading, and all three are the same table read differently:

    delta       how much of the reading moved this round, as a percentage of the whole. Small early
                and large once the mixing has taken hold.
    coherence   what share of the rounds wrote a signature no other round wrote. A collision is a
                null permutation: a move this reading cannot see.
    turn        the rotation recovered from the twist, in radians, with the sign giving which way.

The geometry, the placements and the three readings live in boundary_read, which knows nothing about
hashes. Here is the part that knows: the compression, and what to ask of it.
