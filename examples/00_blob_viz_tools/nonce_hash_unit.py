"""The nonce and its hash as one unit: local entropy of the pair across the 14k real blocks.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_hash_unit.py --check     the controls, each able to fail
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_hash_unit.py             the reading over the corpus

WHY THE PAIR AND NOT EITHER ALONE

The nonce alone and the hash alone both read flat. The pair is not the same object: the hash is a
deterministic function of the nonce and the header, a nonce and its own hash carry a link that a
nonce and a stranger's hash do not. Reading the two as one unit is reading that link. The measure is
local, because a link that is real locally can cancel over the whole unit exactly as it did for the
nonce alone.

THE MEASURE

The unit is the nonce's 32 bits followed by the hash's 256 bits, 288 in all. Its local order is the
sum over sliding windows of one minus the window's bit entropy: a window that is a solid run of the
same bit contributes one, a balanced window contributes nothing. A unit carrying local structure has
a higher local order than a unit that does not.

THE CONFOUND, HANDLED IN THE NULL

A winning hash has about seventy-eight leading zero bits by construction, a long solid run that is
pure local order and tells nothing new: it is the hash winning, which is already known. So the null
draws a unit with the SAME leading zeros, a random nonce and a hash of that many zeros then a random
tail. The winning unit read against that null carries structure only if it beats a unit whose sole
order is the leading zeros it shares. The pairing test exists for that.

THE OTHER READING

The diff between the nonce's own local order and the hash tail's, per block, across the corpus. If the
nonce and its hash tail share a local-entropy relationship, the diff is narrower than a shuffled
pairing of nonces with other blocks' hash tails gives. The shuffle is the null.

WHAT IS HELD

Every number here is about the nonce and sits under the fail-closed partition as HELD.
