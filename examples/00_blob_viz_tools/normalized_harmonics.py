    row = flat_harmonics(8, x, cos_lon, sin_lon, 60)

THE CONVENTION IS IN THE FILENAME BECAUSE THIS TREE HOLDS BOTH, AND THEY DISAGREE

`examples/proofing/exact_harmonics.py` already evaluates associated Legendre values at arbitrary
width, in BINARY fixed point, and it arrived at the same thesis first: "a floor that MOVES when the
width moves belongs to the format, and one that does not belongs to the object." That module is the
prior work and this one does not replace it.

What it does not share is the convention, and the gap is not small:

    examples/proofing/exact_harmonics.py     unnormalized, WITH the Condon-Shortley sign,
                                             P_m^m = (-1)^m (2m-1)!! sin^m, binary fixed point
    this module, and sphere_field.py         normalized, NO Condon-Shortley sign, the climb
                                             kept at unit scale, decimal arithmetic

The two therefore differ by sqrt((2l+1)(l-m)! / (4 pi (l+m)!)) and by a sign in the odd orders.
Either is a correct convention; mixing them is not, and the mixture would be quiet, because the low
degrees would look nearly right and only the fine structure would be wrong. This file exists in the
normalized convention because every reading, coefficient vector and rank measurement in this tree is
in that convention, and a precision tool in the other one cannot grade any of them.

SO THE TWO ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE AND NEITHER IS REDUNDANT. The older module is the right one for
a single basis value carried to great width in integers. This one is the right one for a whole
READING, because the reading's rank, conditioning and residual are all defined in the normalized
convention and only there.

WHY THIS EXISTS

`sphere_field` evaluates this basis in double precision, a format with a floor. Its floor is
4.005e-16 and falls 0.9861 decades per digit. A difference sitting below that floor is not absent:
it is unrepresentable by the instrument reading it. Anything hidden
under a double's last digit is invisible to every tool in this tree that reads doubles, and it is
not invisible to this one.

THE ONLY TRANSCENDENTAL HERE IS ONE COSINE, AND THAT IS A DESIGN CHOICE

Arbitrary-precision inverse trigonometry is slow and easy to get subtly wrong. This module never
calls for any. The harmonics do not want the colatitude, they want its cosine, and the longitude
enters only as cos(m*longitude) and sin(m*longitude):

    cos(colatitude) = y / radius                      algebraic
    sin(colatitude) = sqrt(1 - cos^2)                 algebraic, one square root
    cos(longitude)  = x / flat                        algebraic
    sin(longitude)  = z / flat                        algebraic
    cos(m*lon), sin(m*lon)                            de Moivre recurrence from the pair above

So no arccosine, no arctangent, and the whole basis is square roots and rational arithmetic. The
single series evaluation in the file is the cosine of the golden angle, needed once to lay the
placement out, and the placement's own spiral then advances by a de Moivre recurrence as well.

PI COMES FROM OUR TABLE AND THERE IS NO FALLBACK

`math.pi` is a double. A module whose whole purpose is to carry more than sixteen digits cannot
reach for it, and this one raises if the table is missing instead of quietly capping itself. The
harmonic unit sqrt(1/4pi) is the only place pi enters the basis at all, since every other factor in
the recurrence is the square root of a rational.

WHAT IS MATCHED, EXACTLY

The convention is `sphere_field.legendre_column` and `sphere_field.harmonics_at`, term for term:
no Condon-Shortley sign, the diagonal climbed before the degree recurrence, row l holding 2l+1
values ordered from -l to +l, and the m>0 pair scaled by sqrt(2). `--agree` measures this and does
not assert it: the two implementations are evaluated at the same directions and differenced. A
basis convention that drifts between two implementations produces pictures that look right and
numbers that are wrong, the failure this tree has already had once in CUDA.
