"""Whether a boundary reading conserves the information in its object, tested by recovering it.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/conserved.py --check
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/conserved.py                 the round trip, and where the kernel comes from
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/conserved.py --radiate       is any finite source combination nonradiating

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST

One reading: a boundary reading conserves one quantity, the monopole, instead of conserving
information, and the kernel is where the rest goes. The other: the kernel is background the
reading is not reading and not information the reading destroys.

"Conserves information" has an exact operational meaning and it is testable: take an object, read
it, and try to recover the object from the reading alone. If the recovery lands at the arithmetic
floor then the reading carried everything and nothing was lost. That is a measurement instead of a
definition. This file runs it.

WHAT IT COMES BACK AS

A degree-L reading carries (L+1)^2 real numbers, and N sources carry N. At degree 15 the count
first reaches 256 and at 16 it exceeds it. So the question has a different answer on either side of
that line, and both answers are correct about different readings:

    TRUNCATED BELOW THE COUNT     the map has a kernel, the recovery fails, and the part it fails
                                  on is the kernel component. Information is not carried.
    AT OR ABOVE THE COUNT         the kernel is empty, the recovery lands at the arithmetic floor,
                                  and every one of the N numbers comes back. Information IS carried.

So the kernel of a truncated reading is a property of the truncation and not of the boundary.

THE SHARPER QUESTION, AND IT SETTLES IT

Is there a combination of these sources that radiates nothing at all, at every degree, so that no
reading at any degree or any precision could ever find it? For a finite set of point sources at
distinct positions the answer is no, and `--radiate` shows it: the kernel dimension falls to zero
as the degree rises and stays there. Distinct point sources are linearly independent as
distributions. No nonzero combination of them is nonradiating.

The genuinely nonradiating sources exist in the CONTINUUM, where a volume distribution has
infinitely many degrees of freedom and particular ones cancel in the exterior. They are not
reachable as a finite combination of point sources, which means the nonradiating obstruction is
real and does not apply to any model in this tree.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT SHOW

It does not show that a reading of a physical field conserves anything. This is the linear algebra
of a specific map, measured. And conditioning is left out deliberately: a recovery can be exact in
arithmetic and still be useless against noise, which is a separate axis reported by reading_rank
and not confused with this one.
