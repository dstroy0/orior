"""Local entropy of the interior instead of the whole field: the wave cancels over the whole field. Read locally.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_local.py --check      the controls, each able to fail
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_local.py              the local-disturbance reading over the corpus

WHY LOCAL

Every global reading of the nonce came back flat: correlation, self-delta, ring position, support, all
max entropy over the whole field. That is the wave canceling over the whole system. It does not mean
the field is featureless. A field can be maximum entropy globally and carry massive disturbances
locally, a run of agreeing bits in one neighborhood balanced by a run of disagreeing bits in another.
The two sum to nothing and a global statistic sees nothing. The disturbance is real and only a
local reading finds it.

WHAT IS MEASURED

The 256 output bits sit at fixed directions on the sphere, the same golden spiral the whole view uses.
Each bit's neighborhood is its nearest directions by angle. The local one-fraction of a neighborhood
is how many of its bits are set, and its local entropy is the binary entropy of that fraction: one
where the neighborhood is balanced, zero where it is a solid run. The LOCAL ORDER of a field is the
sum over neighborhoods of one minus that entropy, the total departure from local balance. A globally
balanced field still carries local order where the bits clump, and that is the disturbance the global
statistics canceled away.

THE NULL AND THE NUISANCE

Local order rises with imbalance. The null must be drawn at the SAME bit weight the field carries,
or it reports the weight and calls it structure. The null here draws random fields at each measured
field's own popcount. A field whose local order sits above that weight-matched band is locally more
ordered than chance at its own weight; inside the band it is not, and the disturbance was the weight.

WHAT IS HELD

Every number here is about the nonce and sits under the fail-closed partition as HELD.
