"""The alphabet and word web of the 14k (nonce, hash) units, read as connected components.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_web.py --check     the controls, each able to fail
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_web.py             the web over the corpus

THE FRAMING

Each block is a WORD, the nonce followed by its hash. The ALPHABET is the sub-patterns those words are
built from, the length-L windows that appear across the corpus. A word web joins two words that share
a RARE sub-pattern, one carried by only a few words, because a common one joins everybody and says
nothing. The web is a graph, and its algebraic topology begins with H0, the connected components: the
same object orior builds when it takes the transitive closure of a relation into classes.

THE MEASURE

Every negative here is a boundary instead of a failure: it says the words do not link on shared rare
sub-patterns at this length, which maps where the structure is not. The reading is the component
structure, the count of non-singleton components and the largest one, against a null of random units
with the same leading zeros and nonce weight. Real words that link more than random do it because they
share sub-patterns beyond chance; matching the null is the boundary that says they do not.

WHY RARE

A sub-pattern in almost every word is the leading zeros, which link everybody and carry no
information. A sub-pattern in a handful is a feature those few share, and it is the only kind that can
carry a web with structure. The rarity ceiling is swept instead of chosen. The reading is a curve over
how rare a shared pattern has to be to count.

WHAT IS HELD

Every number here is about the nonce and sits under the fail-closed partition as HELD.
