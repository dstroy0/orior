WHAT THIS IS FOR

"That's what the other engine arms are for, you can size them, shape them, pos and move
anywhere." And: "those are the demons arms."

arm_rank.py reads the wall from the wrong side: 1024 cap arms at two megabytes still give rank
256, the source count. More arms buy nothing past that. It does not ask how FEW arms reach it, and that question only becomes answerable once the kernel is known in advance.

null_first.py supplies exactly that. A degree-8 harmonic reading has rank 81 over 256 sources.
It is blind in 175 dimensions, and an SVD hands over an explicit basis for them before any arm is
placed. An arm's center, radius and weighting are all free. So the arms can be pointed AT the
blindness and not sprinkled and hoped over.

THE PREDICTION, STATED BEFORE THE RUN SO THE RESULT CAN REFUTE IT

Aimed arms should close the kernel with fewer arms than random ones, because two random caps often
add the same direction twice while two aimed caps are pointed at directions that are orthogonal by
construction.

It should NOT be one arm per kernel dimension. A cap arm is an indicator over a region. The rows
it can produce live in the span of indicator functions, and a kernel direction is generally not one
of those. aimed placement should help and should still fall short of the 175 that a perfect
basis-matched instrument would need. If it reached exactly 175 that would mean the caps happened to
span the kernel, which would be a surprise and worth checking and not celebrating.

HOW AN ARM IS AIMED

Each kernel basis vector carries a weight per source. The arm is centered on the source direction
where that weight is largest in absolute value. That is the crudest possible aiming and it is
chosen for exactly that reason: if the crude version works, the effect is about knowing the kernel
and not about a clever placement rule.
