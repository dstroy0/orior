THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR

Four builders share `room_view_template.html`, and only `build_sha_clock_view.py` puts a `clock` key
in the JSON it writes. Nothing else in the tree says which builder's data satisfies which template's
reads. A builder can therefore drop a key the template needs and no gate notices: every gate here asks
whether the code runs, and none asks whether the data is there.

WHAT THIS TOOL FOUND FIRST, WHICH WAS ITS OWN AUTHOR WRONG

The page above was written up as broken on the strength of one line, `CLOCK = DATA.clock`, read out
of a grep whose pattern stopped at the first space. The line is `var CLOCK = DATA.clock || null;` and
the fallback was outside the match.

Every one of the eight reads of `DATA.clock` in that template is guarded: two `if (DATA.clock)`
blocks, four ternaries carrying defaults, one short circuit, and the assignment with its `|| null`.
`DATA.sources` is `|| 2`. So the template supports a clock-less page deliberately, `CLOCK` becomes
`null` instead of `undefined`, `panelReady` returns false, and the panels are correctly absent
instead of dead. The page was the wrong page to serve and it was not a broken one.

A mechanism was asserted from a truncated regex. That is the failure this tree keeps recording under
new names: the quantity reported was not the quantity intended. It is written here because this file
was being built to catch that class and introduced an instance of it on the way.

So the tree currently has **no** page with an unguarded missing key, and that is a fact about the
templates worth knowing instead of a reason to skip the gate. The gate errors the next
builder, and the next template read written without a default.

WHAT THIS ASKS INSTEAD

Take the built page, which carries both halves in one file. Pull the JSON literal out of
`var DATA = {...}`, collect every `DATA.<path>` the script reads, and walk each path into the parsed
data.

A path stops being a data path as soon as it leaves the dictionaries. `DATA.sources.length` is a
`sources` key followed by a JavaScript property. The walk descends while the value is a mapping
and stops when it is not. Anything past that point is the language's business.

GUARDED AND UNGUARDED, BECAUSE ONLY ONE OF THEM IS A DEFECT

A template legitimately asks whether an optional key is present. `if (DATA.things)` is a question and
an absent `things` is the answer. `CLOCK = DATA.clock` is not a question.

A missing key is therefore reported either way and **fails** only when nothing guards it. A guard on
a parent covers its children, since a page that asks whether `clock` is there owns what it does
underneath `clock`, and that spares this tool from counting braces to find the enclosing block.

WHAT `--check` GRADES

Eight guard shapes, one at a time. Marking every one of them guarded would pass anything. The
prefix rule, both ways: a guard on the parent covers the
child, and covers nothing else. The brace counter, against a literal with braces inside its strings.
The walk, which has to leave the dictionaries at `sources.length` and stay inside them at
`clock.hold`.

Then a written sample carrying one unguarded absent key, because the tree has none and a checker
nobody has seen fire is a checker nobody has tested. Then both real pages, which have to come back
clean for their two different reasons.
