"""A dark room you stand inside, with a beam you carry and things that stop it.

    python tools/view/build_room_view.py
    python tools/view/build_room_view.py --shell cube --things 9 --seed 4
    python tools/view/build_room_view.py --blob firmware.bin

  --shell     the enclosing wall: sphere, cube, hexagon, octahedron, dodecahedron. Default sphere.
  --core      the shell holding the lights: sphere, cube, octahedron, cone. Default cube.
  --things    how many lights hang inside. Default 160.
  --seed      draw for their places, sizes and stopping power. Default 4.
  --blob      take the objects from a file instead of the draw, one per common byte value.
  --out       where to write. Default: room_view.html in build/view, through out_path.

WHAT THIS IS FOR

Everything else here looks at a boundary from outside it. This puts the reader inside, because the
outside of one shell is the inside of the next one and there is no vantage point that is not inside
something. Zooming in far enough passes through the inner shell and leaves you among the objects.
Zooming out far enough puts the inner shell behind you and leaves you inside the room.

THE BEAM

The light is carried instead of fixed. Moving it sweeps the shadows across the wall, and a shadow that
sweeps is worth more than a shadow that sits: two objects that overlap from one place separate from
the next, and the rate a shadow moves against the wall gives the depth of the thing casting it.

Objects have a stopping power apiece and the beam has an energy. An object stops the beam where its
stopping power is above that energy. Turning the energy up switches shadows off one at a time,
weakest first. That is the only honest way to draw a probe that mostly passes through: a surface is
opaque to a neutron most of the time and to a neutrino almost never, and the difference between
those two sentences is a cross-section falling with energy and not a wall becoming a window.

WHY THE SHELL SHAPE IS A CONTROL

The wall can be a sphere, a cube, a hexagonal drum or a solid with twelve faces. The shadow pattern
looks different on each and carries the same thing. Offering the choice makes that checkable. What
a boundary can hold is set by its area and the finest detail that reaches it, and not by its shape.
Switching the wall and watching the reading survive is how that stops being an assertion.
