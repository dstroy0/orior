"""What a different arrangement of arms recovers that the octants cannot, as a rank and an angle.

THE QUESTION

The eight sign octants are an arm set of rank 8, blind in 248 of 256 directions. That rank is a
property of THAT CHOICE and not a law: `theory/workbooks/orior/arm-records.md` defines an arm as a weight function
over the placement and an arm set as a matrix whose rank is what the reading carries. So the obvious
question is whether some other arrangement of eight arms sees directions the octants do not, and by
how much.

The blind directions are the null space of the reading map, and the null space belongs to the MAP
and not to the object. Change the arms and the kernel changes with them, an object invisible
to one arm set can be visible to another. This measures that instead of asserting it.

WHAT IS REPORTED, AND WHY THREE NUMBERS AND NOT ONE

  rank            how many independent numbers this arm set carries at all
  new directions  rank of the octants and this set stacked, less the rank of the octants alone
  reach           the largest principal angle cosine between this set's row space and the
                  octants' null space, a set that only re-reads what the octants already had
                  scores near zero however high its own rank

Rank alone is not enough and the reason is the failure this tree keeps meeting. An arm set of rank 8
that spans the SAME subspace as the octants has the same rank and recovers nothing, and a rank
number on its own cannot tell those apart. The stacked rank can, and the angle says how much of the
old kernel the new arms actually reach into.

WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED

Nothing here says a higher rank is a better reading. Rank is a ceiling on what can be recovered and
says nothing about whether the recovered directions matter. A rank-16 arm set blind to everything of
consequence is arithmetically better and practically worse than a rank-8 set that is not.

    THE QUESTION THIS SETTLES. An arm is cheap: a weight per placement point, a few kilobytes.

    piled up without limit and the reading grows with them.

    It does not. An arm set is a matrix of a rows over N placement points, and its rank is at most
    min(a, N). The placement has N degrees of freedom. Once the arms span that space another arm
    adds nothing, whatever it costs and however many there are. The ceiling is the OBJECT'S
    dimension and not the machine's.

    That is the same rank bound the rest of this work is about, arriving from a new direction: it

def _efficiency():
    """How many arms it takes to reach full rank, and whether where they sit changes the answer.

    THE QUESTION RANK ALONE CANNOT ASK, AND WHY THE FIRST READING OF THIS WAS SHALLOW.
    Eight independent arms give rank 8. So do the eight sign octants, and so does any other eight
    that are independent. Reporting that a different eight "recovered eight directions the octants
    could not see" is true and says less than it sounds: at eight arms rank 8 is the ceiling, and the
    octants already reach it. A different arrangement buys DIFFERENT directions instead of more.

    The quantity that actually varies is INDEPENDENCE. An arm set of k arms has rank at most
    min(k, N), and whether it attains that is a property of where the arms sit. The agglomeration
    sweep already showed it failing: 128 random cap arms came back at rank 126 and 256 at rank 250.
    Independence starts going before the state space is full.

    So the well-posed question is the efficiency one. How many arms does a placement strategy need
    to reach rank N, and does a strategy exist that never wastes one? The floor is N arms, since
    rank cannot exceed the count, and anything above N is waste that a better arrangement would not
