WHAT IS MEASURED AND WHAT IS REMEMBERED

Everything below comes out of `miner_totals.txt` and `miner.log`, which the client writes itself.
The one number not out of a log is the starting point: the engine began at about 30 MH/s, and no
log in the tree goes back that far. That figure is labeled remembered and not measured every time
it is used.

THE RETURN RATE IS THE INTERESTING ONE AND IT IS A CORRECTNESS CHECK, NOT A YIELD FIGURE

A miner's share rate is fully determined by its hash rate and the difficulty it is given. So the
observed rate is a test: if shares arrive at the predicted spacing the client is doing real work and
losing none of it, and if they arrive slower the work is being wasted somewhere between the kernel
and the wire. With 3 of 3 accepted and 0 rejected, the question is whether the SPACING matches, and
that pins down the implied difficulty without needing the pool to be trusted about it.
