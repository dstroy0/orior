"""Builds a page for watching the worker pool: what it hit, and how hard it is cooking.

WHAT THIS IS FOR AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY LEAVES ALONE

Braiins' own dashboard already reports the pool side: accepted work, payouts, worker status. This
page does not duplicate any of that. What it has and the pool does not is the LOCAL side and the
CHAIN side together: device telemetry from this machine, the client's own accumulated counters, the
measured scaling that decides the pool size, and the real difficulty read out of a verified block
corpus and not quoted.

EVERY NUMBER ON THE PAGE IS MEASURED OR IT IS LABELED

The page is built from four sources, all local and all real:

    nvidia-smi              temperature, power, `utilization.gpu`, clocks, fan
    miner_totals.txt        the client's own hashes, shares, rejects, seconds, runs
    miner.log               the running hash rate samples, for the trace
    blocks_deep.json        6980 real blocks, for the target and the difficulty

Anything that could not be read is shown as absent and not filled with a plausible number, and
anything assumed carries the word. A dashboard that invents a figure is worse than one with a gap,
because a gap is visible and an invention is not.

SELF CONTAINED

One file, no network, no CDN, no interpreter. That is the tree's convention for these pages and it
is the property that makes a page worth keeping: it opens in five years on a machine with none of
this installed. The output location is resolved through `out_path` so the tool never writes beside
itself.
