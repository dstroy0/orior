"""What an eye's WIDTH is worth, and what knowing a source's position is worth.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/fractal_spike.py            the ladder, the nulls, and the width sweep
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/fractal_spike.py --check    grade the instrument before trusting a number

THE QUESTION:

    "we can represent this problem however we want in as many dimensions as we want and if a qubit
     knows its position and a null permutation gives identity then the demon arm sweeping infinite
     space"
    "If it's the two of them there s a fundamental integral we don't know"
    "Other path is a macro fractal spike"
    "The shape if were 3d looks like a jellyfish with 4 balloons"
    "It's like four fractal spikes between those at oblique angles from the balloons and a larger
     spike in the center"

WHAT IS ALREADY SETTLED AND IS NOT RE-ARGUED HERE. The stacked reading closes: arms take the rank to
the SOURCE COUNT, measured at 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024, with arms-to-closure equal to sources - 81
every time, the 81 being the degree-8 harmonic block's own rank. There is no missing rank to find,
and the reason is not empirical. At bandlimit L every function on the sphere lives in an (L+1)^2
dimensional space, and EVERY reading of ANY kind - a region integral, a line integral, a point
evaluation, an integral against any measure whatever - is a linear functional on that space. The
span of all conceivable integrals is therefore exactly (L+1)^2, and no integral nobody has thought
of yet exceeds it. Beams added 175 dimensions at degree 8 not because a line integral escapes the
space but because the region rows did not span it: 81 + 175 = 256.

SO "A FUNDAMENTAL INTEGRAL WE DON'T KNOW" HAS NO ROOM TO EXIST at fixed degree. That branch closes
by dimension counting and this file does not test it. The other branch is wide open, because rank
is not the scarce thing. CONDITIONING is, and the difference shows twice: degree 15 complete at a
least singular value of 3.5e-3 against degree 16 at 1.5e-1, and the orthogonal spiral offset where
the concurrent set comes out best conditioned at 8.18e+02 against 3.74e+09, seven orders of
magnitude at IDENTICAL rank.

WHAT THIS FILE MEASURES, in the order the measurements force it.

1. THE MACRO LADDER LOSES. Widths doubling from the source spacing to the shell diameter - four
   rungs, which is where the four balloons come from and the number is derived, log2(9.02) = 3.17 -
   condition at best 2.4e+03 against 6.0e+01 for the single scale already in use. Every variant of
   the ladder is worse than not having it. The count exponent is swept over 0, 1 and 2 and not
   picked, and all three lose.

2. THE SELF-SIMILAR LAYOUT IS REAL BUT SMALL. Against its own null - the same multiset of widths
   with the assignment shuffled - the ladder wins by four orders of magnitude at exponent 0 and
   loses at exponent 1. So layout matters and is worth a factor of a few against width's factor of
   ten million. It is the second-order term.

3. WIDTH IS THE WHOLE EFFECT AND THE DERIVED FLOOR IS THE WRONG BOUND. Taking the source spacing
   as a delta limit makes the shipped BEAM_WIDTH of 0.10 a defect for sitting below it. The
   measurement says it works because it sits below it: a near-delta row is nearly a
   row of the identity, a stack of them is nearly orthogonal, while a wide row is nearly the
   monopole and a stack of those is nearly rank one. Narrow wins by construction.

4. AND THEN THE NULL PICKS UP THE TURF. The narrow sweep reports condition 4.86 at width 0.003
   with the rank never breaking, and that number measures the AIMING instead of the instrument.
   `beam_set` aims beam `at` at source `(at * 7 + 1) % 256`, and 7 is coprime to 256. The aiming
   is a PERMUTATION: one beam pointed at each source. Shrink the width and the matrix becomes a
   permuted identity for free. The aimed instrument is built out of the answer.

THE RESULT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR is the gap between those two aimings, because it is the price of
the question's first clause - "if a qubit knows its position":

    width / spacing      aimed cond    blind cond    blind rank
              1.000       2.77e+02      3.44e+02           256
              0.707        5.40e+01      8.32e+01           256     <- shipped BEAM_WIDTH
              0.500       2.45e+01      6.23e+01           256     <- the blind optimum
              0.250       1.01e+01      2.74e+02           256
              0.088       6.35e+00      6.10e+08           256
              0.022       4.86e+00      1.28e+13           130

The aimed column slides to 4.86 and never breaks. The blind column has a genuine MINIMUM at half
the source spacing and then collapses eleven orders of magnitude, taking 126 sources with it into
rows that touch nothing at all. Knowing the position is worth 13x in conditioning and the whole
difference between a complete reading and a third of the object invisible. That is the null
permutation with a number on it, and the number has to be paid in advance: the aiming IS the
position, an instrument that uses it has been handed what it was built to find.

THE SHIPPED WIDTH IS A QUARTER TOO WIDE, found blind. 0.10 conditions at 8.32e+01 and 0.0687
conditions at 6.23e+01, with both complete and neither using a source position.

WHAT IS NOT TESTED HERE and is the obvious next thing: the interleaved oblique arrangement, four
narrow sets placed in the GAPS of the wide ones and not along the same golden directions. Every
rung in this file draws from the same golden placement at its own count. The wide and narrow
rungs point down nearly the same lines and the wide rungs are largely redundant. That is a real
defect in the ladder as built and it is the most likely reason layout came out second-order.
