"""Machine B in the boundary field, steered in exact NTT limbs: no float, no format floor.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/o2_ntt_boundary.py --check     the controls, each able to fail
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/o2_ntt_boundary.py             the meeting sweep over a real header

WHY EXACT AND NOT A FLOAT ANGLE

An angle between two fields taken in float64 carries a floor near 4e-16 that belongs to the FORMAT
and not to the boundary. Steering on it cannot discriminate past that floor whatever the data holds.
The steering here is the exact cross-correlation of the two bit fields, taken through the proven NTT
ring twiddle_proof.py establishes and four_step.py folds. The bit values are 0 and 1 and the length
is 256. Every correlation entry is at most 256, well under the modulus, and the residue IS the
true integer. No value is ever rounded. The discrimination is bounded by the data and not by a
float floor. A steer bounded by a float floor bottoms out, and this one does not.

THE TWO MACHINES

Machine A, what a nonce IS: forward the double hash to round r of the second block, read the 256 bit
state, and that is the field F_r.

Machine B, what a winner CAN BE: the target admits only digests whose top L bits are zero, and that
zero pattern is a field T computed from the target alone.

THE ANSWER TO THE DIFFERENCE is the exact cross-correlation of F_r with T. The round where the
winner's correlation pulls away from the losers around it is the meeting round, read from the data.
Earlier than the round-61 anchor and a boundary-field question prunes what the anchor cannot; at 61
or later it gives nothing new, and the exact number says which, with no float floor to hide behind.

WHAT IS HELD

Every number here is about the nonce and sits under the fail-closed partition as HELD.
