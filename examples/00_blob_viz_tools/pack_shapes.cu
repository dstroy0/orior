/* Greedy packing on a surface, on the device. The count can be taken where sampling on a host
 * cannot reach.
 *
 * Prints one line: shape dims gap typical kept candidates
 *
 * WHAT IS ON THE DEVICE AND WHAT IS NOT
 *
 * Greedy packing is sequential by definition: whether a point is kept depends on every point kept
 * before it. What parallelizes is the expensive half, which is asking one candidate whether it
 * clears every point already kept. So the device answers that for a batch at a time and the host
 * walks the batch in order, settling the few candidates that clear the kept set against each other.
 *
 * The answer is the same answer a purely sequential pass would give, and that is checked instead of
 * asserted: the driver runs this and the host version over the same shapes at low dimensions
 * where both can reach, and the counts have to agree.
 *
 * WHY THE GAP IS NOT PASSED IN
 *
 * A gap that means one thing on a sphere means another on a cube of nominally similar size, and a
 * fixed gap stops meaning anything at all as the dimension climbs. So the caller asks for a
 * fraction, the device measures the middle distance between two points on this surface, and the gap
 * is that fraction of it. The fraction is comparable across shapes and dimensions where an absolute
 * length is not.
