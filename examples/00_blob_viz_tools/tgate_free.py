THE CLAIM UNDER TEST

"We dont have these problems", about the T gate and the non-Clifford gates generally, and "prove
that we dont have those problems."

The claim holds. On fault-tolerant hardware a T gate is the expensive gate, and the expense is not
the rotation: it is MAGIC STATE DISTILLATION.
A logical T needs a distilled |A> state, distillation consumes many noisy copies to make one clean
one, and the overhead is thousands of physical qubits and many rounds per logical T. For that reason
architectures are graded on T-count and T-depth.

NONE OF THAT APPLIES HERE, and the reason is arithmetic and not clever.

    T = diag(1, exp(i pi / 4))    and    exp(i pi / 4) = (1 + i) / sqrt(2)

sqrt(2) is row root_two of dn_constants.csv, held to a thousand places with two routes agreeing at
a zero gap. So the T gate's entire content is a multiplication by a number this tree already owns
exactly. No distillation, no magic state, no ancilla, no fault tolerance budget.

THE PROOF IS TWO EXACT NULLS AND THEY ARE FREE

    T^8 = I     because exp(i pi / 4) to the eighth is exp(2 pi i) = 1. Apply T eight times and
                the state must return EXACTLY, to the arithmetic floor of the working precision. If
                T gates cost precision, eight of them would show it. This is the decisive one.

    T^2 = S     because exp(i pi / 4) squared is exp(i pi / 2) = i, the S gate, and S is
                Clifford and already implemented independently in this file's simulator. Two T gates
                must equal one S exactly, which cross-checks the new gate against old machinery
                and not against itself.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE, AND --wall MEASURES IT

The T gate is free. The STATE is not. A non-Clifford gate takes the state out of the stabilizer set.
The graph form stops applying and the full 2^n amplitude array is required. That is the real
limit here and it is a qubit count instead of a gate count: the opposite of the hardware situation, where
qubits are plentiful relative to distilled T gates.
