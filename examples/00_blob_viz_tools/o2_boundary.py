"""Machine B in the boundary-field representation: where the forward state meets the target's shape.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/o2_boundary.py --check      the controls, each able to fail
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/o2_boundary.py              the meeting sweep over a real header

THE TWO MACHINES, IN ONE FIELD

Machine A, what a nonce IS: run the double hash forward to round r of the second block and read the
256 bit state there. Placed on the sphere at the golden-spiral directions the whole view uses, that
state is a boundary field F_r.

Machine B, what a winner CAN BE: the target admits only digests whose top L bits are zero. That
constraint is a shape too, the field T of the pattern "top L bits zero, the rest free". T is computed
from the target alone and never looks at any nonce.

THE ANSWER TO THE DIFFERENCE is the angle between F_r and T. A true winner's FINAL field sits at
zero angle to T by construction, because its top L bits are the zero bits T is made of. The question
is how far back from the last round that closeness survives: the round where the winner's angle to T
drops inside the non-winners around it is the meeting round, and it is read from the data instead of set.

WHY THIS IS THE HONEST TEST

If the meeting round is earlier than the round-61 anchor, a boundary-field question run to that round
prunes nonces the anchor cannot, and the recursion earns a saving the count in o2_nonce.py would then
show. If the winner only pulls away from the field at round 61 or later, the boundary field gives no
meeting the anchor does not already have, and this reports that with the winner's angle beside the
non-winners' at every round. The avalanche makes the second prediction the likely one; the point is
to measure it in this representation and not assume it.

WHAT IS HELD

Every number here is about the nonce and sits under the fail-closed partition as HELD.
