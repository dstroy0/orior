"""Does a boundary reading of an early compression state predict the final digest?

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_read.py --check
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_read.py                 the sweep, against a matched null

WHY THIS IS THE QUESTION AND NOT A DIFFERENT ONE

Reading the FINAL state is reading the digest, because the digest is the feed-forward of all sixty
four rounds. That is trivially informative and completely useless: to have the final state you have
already done the work. Nothing is saved.

The question with something at stake is whether an EARLY state predicts the final digest. If a
reading after sixteen rounds carried any signal about the leading zeros after sixty four, a miner
could abandon hopeless nonces early and the cost per share would fall. That is the only shape in
which this machinery could touch mining.

WHAT THIS TREE ALREADY KNOWS, STATED BEFORE THE RUN SO THE RESULT IS NOT A SURPRISE

The transform workbook graded twenty hypotheses, H1 through H20, and they came back null: survivor
counts track the cost model exactly, no bit or byte position departs from flat, and the standing
constraint recorded in PARTITION.tsv is that NO PROJECTION OVER THE DIGEST REDUCES THE NUMBER OF
EVALUATIONS AT ALL. So the honest prior is that this returns null too.

Running it anyway is worth the time for one reason: a null with a measured detection limit is a
result, and a null asserted from a prior is not. If the correlation is below what this sample could
have seen, that bound is the finding.

THE NULL IS MATCHED AND DRAWN, NOT DERIVED

The same features are correlated against a SHUFFLED pairing of nonce to digest, which destroys any
real relationship while preserving every marginal distribution. The bar is then the largest
correlation the shuffled data produces over the same number of features, because reporting the
loudest of many against a single-feature threshold manufactures findings. This tree has made that
mistake and the rule is written in anisotropy_detector.py.
