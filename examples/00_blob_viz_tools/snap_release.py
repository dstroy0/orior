"""The fourth term as the operation it exists for: a qubit snapping its vector to release entanglement.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/snap_release.py --check
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/snap_release.py               the two snaps, measured against the state vector
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/snap_release.py --cost        what the fourth term costs and what it buys

WHY FOUR TERMS AND NOT THREE

"It needs to be 4, the integral allows for the qubit to snap its vector and switch position to
release entanglement."

STATIC capacity is a different question: how many reals it takes to write down an arbitrary pure
state, which is 2^(n+1) - 2, against a fixed budget of c*n. Four reals a qubit is exact through
two qubits and short from three on, and no amount of precision moves that line. All true, and
none of it about the snap.

The fourth term is not storage for an amplitude. It is a MAGNITUDE OF 0 OR 1 saying whether this
qubit is currently entangled at all, and its purpose is to make the snap available. A binary term
cannot hold an arbitrary amplitude and it can hold that perfectly.

THE THREE TERM MACHINE CANNOT ASK THE QUESTION THE SNAP ANSWERS

With a direction and a polarization, a qubit carries where it points. Nothing in it says whether it
is bound to anything. a three term machine cannot tell a free qubit from an entangled one, and
therefore cannot know whether a snap is available or what releasing it would cost. The fourth term
is not extra capacity, it is the predicate the operation is conditioned on.

THE TWO SNAPS, AND THEY ARE BOTH EXACT

Both are standard graph state operations and both are exact on the bits, with no arithmetic:

    RELEASE, which is a Z measurement. Delete every edge on the qubit. It leaves the cluster and
    its entanglement is gone. This is snapping without switching position.

    SWITCH, which is a Y measurement. Complement the edges AMONG the qubit's neighbors, then
    delete the qubit's own edges. The qubit leaves and its neighbors inherit the connectivity.
    The entanglement moves instead of vanishing. This is the snap-and-switch, and the
    local complementation is the switch.

His reading of it was "conservation in action, the system balances itself". The measurement below
is whether that holds: whether SWITCH preserves what RELEASE destroys.

GRADED AGAINST THE STATE VECTOR, NOT AGAINST ITSELF

Entropy here is read as the GF(2) rank of the off diagonal adjacency block, the bits and
never an amplitude array. For small cases the same number is computed from the actual 2^n state
vector and the two must agree. A bit level answer that has never been graded against the thing it
claims to summarize is a claim instead of a measurement.

    A vertex whose complementation barely moves the total is RIGID: the graph resists being twisted

    complementation is a local Clifford operation, and local Clifford operations preserve
    entanglement across every bipartition. So the first list is all zeros for every graph, at every

    That is not a dead measure to be replaced. It is an exact null, in the same family as the other
    exact nulls here, and it says the thing this tree keeps finding from new directions:
    RELABELING IS FREE. A twist moves the description and not the content.

    THE TENSION RESPONSE IS NOT ZERO. The edge count is not a local Clifford invariant. Twisting
    changes how many pairs are bound while leaving what they hold across any cut untouched. That is
