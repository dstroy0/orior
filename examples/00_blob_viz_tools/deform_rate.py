"""How much of a reading's change a rigid motion cannot explain, per unit of source movement.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/deform_rate.py                 the scalar across topologies and moves

THE SCALAR, AND WHY IT IS ONE NUMBER AND NOT A CHOICE OF UNITS

The definition: propagation speed here is a conceptual scalar standing for anisotropic field
deformation, read through torsion and deflection. That is constructible, and it is worth saying
first what it is NOT: no kernel in this tree has a kinematic signal speed. Depth is elliptic and
conduction is the heat semigroup, and both have instantaneous global dependence. So the quantity
below is an IMPEDANCE. Its reciprocal is the thing called speed, and neither is a velocity.

The construction falls out of how the two instruments behave under a rotation:

    a rigid rotation by alpha    multiplies the (l,m) coefficient by exp(-i m alpha)
    deflection                   power per degree, a rotation does not move it AT ALL
    torsion                      phase per (l,m), a rotation moves it by exactly -m alpha

That gives a decomposition with nothing invented in it. Take the reading before and after a move,
read the rigid angle off the order-one phase, apply that rotation to the before reading, and ask how
much of the change is left:

    scalar = || after - rotated(before) ||  /  || after - before ||

Dimensionless, between zero and one, and no unit conversion between a power and a phase is required
because both readings live in the one complex coefficient vector the norm is taken over.

    0     the move was rigid. The reading turned and did not deform.
    1     no rotation helps. The change is entirely shape.

THE NULL IS EXACT AND IT IS THE POINT

A pure rotation must return zero, and it must return zero for every topology and every angle. That
is not a tolerance, it is an identity: the rotated before-reading IS the after-reading. So the
number this tool reports is measured against a floor that belongs to the arithmetic, the same way
every other floor in this tree does, and not against a threshold anybody chose.

WHY TOPOLOGY IS THE OTHER AXIS

The claim: the trick to increasing computation is to explode without confounding the topology,
and the information dissipates more readily. Read as a claim about this scalar it is testable, because the
scalar is deformation per unit of source movement and the source arrangement is free:

    points      sources at one depth, golden placed. The arrangement every reading here uses.
    bubbles     concentric shells at several depths. Depth enters as (r/R)^l. Shells at
                different radii are weighted differently by degree before anything moves.
    foam        sources on the walls between seeds, and not at the seeds. A wall structure
                has its mass between the cells instead of in them.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH

It measures a property of the READING MAP under a stated move, not a property of any physical field.
Nothing here shows that information in any medium propagates at any rate. And the scalar is silent
on whether the deformation it reports carries anything worth having: a large shape change in
directions the map cannot resolve is still a large number here.

    That is impossible for a quantity documented as a fraction between zero and one, and the reason
    is worth keeping: the order-one phase is the exact rotation only when the move IS a rotation.
    For a move that is partly shape, it names an angle that is not the best rigid fit, and applying
    it can leave MORE difference than doing nothing. A scalar above one was the tool reporting that
    its own rotation estimate had made things worse.

    The minimization is done properly here and it is nearly free, because the objective is a
    trigonometric polynomial. Expanding the squared norm,

        || after - rot(before) ||^2 = sum w (|a|^2 + |b|^2) - 2 sum_m Re( c_m exp(-i m alpha) )

    where c_m collects conj(after) times before over every degree at that order. Only the second
    term moves with alpha. Minimizing the norm is maximizing a band-limited sum over orders up to
    the reading degree. A scan at a resolution far finer than that band, refined by a parabola
    through the best three samples, finds the maximum to well under the arithmetic floor.

    Alpha zero is always in the search. The returned angle can never be worse than no rotation
