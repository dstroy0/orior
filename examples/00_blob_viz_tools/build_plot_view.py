"""Plots one or more expressions over a grid and hands them to the shape viewer.

The other generators read something that was measured. This one evaluates something that was
written down. That leaves the same instrument useful for a surface you already understand: a
function whose shape is known is the way to find out what an embedding does to a shape, and a
function nobody has drawn on a torus before is worth a look on its own.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/build_plot_view.py "sin(x)*cos(y)"
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/build_plot_view.py "sin(x)*cos(y)" "sin(2*x)*cos(2*y)" --n 128
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/build_plot_view.py "exp(-(x**2+y**2))" --x -2 2 --y -2 2 --title Gaussian

Each expression becomes one step. A sequence of them can therefore be stepped through in the
page: a function and its derivative, or the same function at rising frequency.

  --x LOW HIGH   range of x, taken as the depth axis. Default -pi to pi.
  --y LOW HIGH   range of y, taken as the series axis. Default -pi to pi.
  --n COUNT      samples on each axis. Default 96. 9216 cells per expression.
  --title TEXT   heading for the page. Default: the first expression.
  --out FILE     where to write. Default: plot_view.html in build/view, through out_path.

What may appear in an expression: x, y, pi, e, tau, and the functions sin cos tan asin acos atan
atan2 sinh cosh tanh exp log log2 log10 sqrt abs floor ceil hypot copysign fmod pow degrees radians
erf gamma, plus min and max. Nothing else is in scope, and nothing in the expression can reach the
interpreter: it is compiled with no builtins and evaluated against that table alone.

Writes a self-contained page: no server, no fetch at run time, nothing to install.
