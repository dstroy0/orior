"""Which interior positions the nonce can move, and where its reach closes: elision read forwards.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_support.py --check     the controls, each able to fail
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/nonce_support.py             the support curve over a real header

WHY THIS AND NOT A FREQUENCY

theory/workbooks/orior/aiming-the-engine.md puts support before frequency. A frequency needs a null, a bar and a
correction, and most come back empty. A support is a hard fact: a position either moved under some
excitation of the nonce or it never did, and one that never did is ELIDED, independent of the nonce
at that depth, ruling out every trajectory that would need it to carry nonce information. No null, no
bar, no p-value. This reads the interior the way the research says to, instead of reading the digest
the way the refuted entries did.

WHAT IS MEASURED

Excite the nonce across many values. At every round of the compression read the whole interior state
and mark a bit position as SUPPORTED if it takes more than one value across the excitations, ELIDED
if it never moves. The support is the set of positions the nonce can still reach at that depth; its
size grows as the avalanche spreads and closes when every position is reachable. Where it closes is
the round past which nothing is elided and no hard constraint can be read, and the research measured
that at round 30 of 64 on the compression function. Past it, a reading returns a floor that looks
like a result, the trap every refuted nonce entry fell into by reading round 61 or 64.

THE NONCE'S PLACE

The nonce is word 3 of the FIRST hash's second block, so that block's rounds 1 to 3 read words no
nonce touches and must be fully elided, the positive control. The SECOND hash takes the
first hash's finished output as its message, and that output already depends on the nonce. Every
second-hash round is supported from the start. The elision window lives in the first hash's second
block, and that is where this looks.

WHAT IS HELD

Every number here is about the nonce and sits under the fail-closed partition as HELD.
