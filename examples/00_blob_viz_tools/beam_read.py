"""Does a BEAM reading of an early compression state predict the final digest?

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/beam_read.py --check
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/beam_read.py                  the sweep, both instruments, matched null

WHY THIS RUNS BESIDE THE NULL IN nonce_read.py

nonce_read.py asks this exact question and reads null, and that null is real. But it is
measured with SIX SCALARS: weight, monopole share, dipole share, quadrupole share, fine-structure
share, and the zonal dipole. Five of those are POWER SHARES, and a power share is invariant under
rotation by construction. An instrument built out of rotation invariants cannot see orientation at
all, no matter how much orientation there is to see.

The state carries 256 numbers, one per bit. That is the rank bound this tree measures four
separate ways, among them beam_rows.py, where 256 line integrals take the stacked reading to rank
256 exactly. So the null in nonce_read.py covers a six-dimensional rotation-averaged summary of a
256-dimensional object. A region integral averages over a patch, and a line integral does not.

WHAT A BEAM IS AND WHY IT IS A DIFFERENT ROW TYPE

A harmonic row is a whole-sphere integral. An arm is a region integral. A BEAM is a LINE integral:
occlusion along a ray, weighted by perpendicular distance to it. beam_rows.py settled that a beam
is not in the span of the region rows, by closing the harmonic reading's entire 175-dimensional
kernel at degree 8 and taking the rank to the source count.

A beam also reads without perturbing: it is a passive occlusion measurement, the sense in
which it observes from outside without disturbing what it observes.

THE HONEST PRIOR, STATED BEFORE THE RUN

Null. The standing constraint in PARTITION.tsv is that no projection over the digest reduces the
number of evaluations, the transform workbook graded twenty hypotheses to null, and nonce_period.py
found no period across 75 tests. Nothing here contradicts that and this tool is not expected to.

What this tool adds is a null measured with a directional instrument and a stated detection limit,
and not a null inherited from an instrument that was blind to direction. A null with a limit is
a result. A null asserted from a prior is not.

THE THREE CONTROLS, ALL OF WHICH MUST PASS FOR A NULL HERE TO MEAN ANYTHING

    1. THE BUILT-IN POSITIVE CONTROL IS FREE. The target is the leading zero count of state 64.
       Reading state 64 is reading the answer. That row MUST fire. If the loudest correlation at
       round 64 does not clear the null bar, the instrument is broken and every other row on the
       page is meaningless. This costs nothing and it is not optional.

    2. THE NULL IS DRAWN INSTEAD OF DERIVED. The bar is the 95th percentile of the LARGEST absolute
       correlation a shuffled pairing produces over the SAME number of features. Shuffling destroys
       any real relation while preserving every marginal. Taking the max in the null too
       makes 256 features and 81 features comparable: reporting the loudest of many against a
       single-feature threshold manufactures findings.

    3. THE LIMIT IS MEASURED BY INJECTION FADE. A correlation is blended into the target at a known
       strength and faded until it stops clearing the bar. The smallest strength still detected is
       what this sample could have seen, and it is the number that gives the null its meaning.

WHAT THIS TOOL DOES NOT CLAIM

It says nothing about qubits. The quantum representation question is a different one, answered in
exact_qubits.py and graph_machine.py, and bolting a qubit onto this measurement would be decoration
and not apparatus. The eye is a classical line integral.

    times per instrument per round, and a Python loop over 256 columns would make the drawn null
    expensive enough to tempt fewer shuffles, the wrong economy.

    A constant column correlates with nothing and is excluded instead of producing a divide by
    zero that numpy would report as nan and argmax would then happily select.

    CONSTANCY IS TESTED EXACTLY AND NOT AGAINST A TOLERANCE. A guard of `spread > 1e-12` is an
    ABSOLUTE threshold on a quantity whose scale depends on how many sources are lit and how the
    rows are normalized. It produces a false positive with a very specific signature:

        at 2048 nonces, round 15 reads exactly 0.0000
        at  192 nonces, round 15 reads        0.0237

    Round 15 is before the nonce enters the state. Its columns are bit-identical and the answer
    has to be zero at every sample count. The difference is the sample count's factorization. 2048
    is a power of two. Summing identical doubles pairwise is exact, the mean comes back exact,
    centering gives exactly zero and the column is excluded. 192 is not. The mean lands a few ulp
    off, the residual noise on features of magnitude around 100 reaches about 1e-12, and it clears
    the threshold and gets correlated against the target like real data.

    A tolerance chosen by judgment makes that possible. `max != min` needs no tolerance: it
    compares stored values, and rows computed from bit-identical inputs by identical arithmetic are
    bit-identical, a genuinely constant column is caught exactly at any sample count.
