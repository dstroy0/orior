"""How many independent numbers a boundary reading actually carries, and how many it cannot.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/reading_rank.py --check

A tool and not a library: it measures one thing and prints it.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR

The octant alphabet separated sixty-four rounds from sixty-four rounds, every signature distinct,
and that was reported as coherence. It is nearly free. Eight real numbers will separate sixty-four
arbitrary states whether the eight numbers mean anything. Distinctness at that sample size
is not evidence and the report should never have implied it was.

What settles it is not a harder sample. It is a rank. The map from lit points to boundary
coefficients is linear -- that linearity is the whole reason a field of many sources sums instead of
needing a solve -- and it therefore has a rank, a null space, and a dimension count that no amount
of sampling and no amount of precision moves. A reading to degree L carries at most (L+1)^2 real
numbers about its source, and every direction of the source space beyond that is invisible by
arithmetic.

WHAT IS MEASURED

    orthonormality   the basis graded against exact quadrature, leaving any rank reported below a
                     property of the map instead of a basis that had already lost digits.
    rank             singular values of the reading matrix, at several reading degrees.
    nullity          the dimension of what the reading cannot see. This bounds every claim of the
                     form "the beams map the whole object".
    the octant map   the same measurement for the eight-letter alphabet, the coarsest reading in
                     the tree and the one whose limit is easiest to overstate.

WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE

Whether the numbers a reading does carry are the interesting ones. Rank is a ceiling on what can be
recovered and says nothing about what is worth recovering. A rank-81 reading blind to every bit of
consequence is arithmetically identical to one that is not.

    THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS
    -------------------------
    An optimizer that maximizes recovered directions per unit cost picks the smallest degree whose
    coefficient count reaches the source count. On a 256-point source that is degree fifteen, and
    degree fifteen is the worst-conditioned complete degree there is -- its least singular value is
    three decades under the degrees on either side, and one degree of headroom recovers a factor of forty-four.
    So the objective is not monotone, and an engine that optimizes the count lands on the one degree
    it should avoid and reports success.

    The open question was whether the degree a reading should actually use tracks the source's depth
    or pins at that same fifteen whatever the depth. This sweep answers it by measurement.
