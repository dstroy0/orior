THE CLAIM

On the QuEra logical magic state distillation result: "the finality conserves."

That is the resource theory of magic stated in three words and it is correct. Distillation does not
manufacture fidelity. It CONCENTRATES it: five noisy magic states become one cleaner state, and the
total quantity of magic does not rise. For that reason the protocol needs five inputs for one output
and not one for one.

WHY THAT MAKES CLIFFORD OPERATIONS FREE IN A STRICT SENSE

A magic monotone is any quantity that cannot increase under the free operations of the theory, and
the free operations are Clifford gates, Pauli measurement and classical post-processing. For a
single qubit the monotone is easy to write down exactly, and that leaves this testable here
and not in the abstract:

    F(psi) = max over the six stabilizer states of |<s|psi>|^2

The six are the Pauli eigenstates, the octahedron vertices recorded in bloch_reach.py. The
single-qubit Clifford group has 24 elements and PERMUTES those six. The maximum over them is
taken over the same set before and after. F is therefore EXACTLY invariant under Clifford, not
approximately, and that is the null this file is built on.

THE THREE THINGS THAT MUST HOLD, AND THE ONE THAT MUST NOT

    EXACT NULL      every Clifford gate leaves F unchanged to the arithmetic floor. Conservation.
    POSITIVE        the T gate changes F. If it did not, T would be free and Clifford plus T could
                    not be universal, a null here would refute the whole picture.
    EXACT VALUE     the magic state |A> = T|+> sits at F = cos^2(pi/8) = (2 + sqrt 2)/4, which is
                    a closed form to grade the measurement against and not a number to trust.
    MUST NOT        no sequence of free operations may raise F above its starting value. That is
                    the conservation law and it is checked by search and not by assertion.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM ABOUT THE QuEra RESULT

Their achievement is that distillation worked on real atoms with real correlated noise and real
transport error. Nothing here reproduces that. This measures the protocol's resource accounting
under an exact noise model, the clean reference curve their noisy data sits against, and
it is a different statement from theirs.
