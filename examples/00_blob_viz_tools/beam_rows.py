"""The neutrino beams as rows in the reading map, and whether they reach where the harmonics cannot.

WHY A BEAM IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF ROW

`build_sha_clock_view.py` already carries these in the picture and states what they do: what stops
the carried beam is the bit being set, what casts the shadow is the stopping, and the pattern on the
wall is the state. A beam is an OCCLUSION ALONG A RAY. That makes it a line integral through the
volume, where every instrument already in the engine is a different shape:

    a harmonic row      integrates the whole lit set against Y_lm over the sphere
    an arm              integrates the weight sitting inside a region
    a BEAM              integrates the weight lying along one line

The arms are the touch, the neutrino beams are the eyes. That is the right distinction and
it is a statement about linear algebra and not about metaphor. A line integral is not in the
span of region integrals. Beams can reach directions the other rows cannot, and this file measures
whether they actually do instead of asserting that they should.

THE CEILING IS UNCHANGED AND THAT IS NOT A DISAPPOINTMENT

Rank cannot exceed the number of sources however many beams are added, the same way 1024 arms at two
megabytes still gave rank 256. Eyes past the rank buy conditioning and not rank. So the question is
never whether beams break the ceiling, it is whether they climb to it from a direction touch cannot.

BOTH CONTROLS RUN, AND THE NEGATIVE ONE DECIDES WHETHER THE REST MEANS ANYTHING

    positive    rows drawn FROM the harmonic kernel must reach 1.0 and must add rank. If they do
                not, the reach measure is broken and every beam number is uninterpretable.
    negative    the harmonic rows restacked on themselves must add exactly nothing. An instrument
                that reports a gain for a copy reports a gain for anything.
