"""Perturbation rotational inertia, per qubit: how hard the state resists being disturbed, by axis.

    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/perturb_inertia.py              the inertia tensor per shape
    python examples/00_blob_viz_tools/perturb_inertia.py --profile    the per-qubit response, not summed

WHY THIS IS NOT THE TWIST, AND WHY IT WILL NOT COME BACK ZERO

"Add perturbation rotational inertia", "per qubit".

snap_release.py already measures the response to a TWIST, which is local complementation, and that
comes back exactly 0.0 at every vertex on every shape. It has to: local complementation is a local
Clifford operation and those preserve entanglement across every bipartition. A twist moves the
description and not the content, the relabeling-is-free result from another direction.

A PERTURBATION IS A DIFFERENT OPERATOR. Toggling the edges on one qubit changes the STATE and leaves its
description alone. It is not a local Clifford and it is not obliged to preserve anything. The response
is therefore live, and because each qubit sits at a position on the shell, the response has an
orientation.

WHAT MAKES IT ROTATIONAL

Each qubit has a place. Perturbing qubit i produces a response r_i, the amount of entanglement
moved. Treating that response as a mass at that qubit's position gives the ordinary inertia tensor

    I = sum_i r_i ( |p_i|^2 delta - p_i p_i^T )

whose eigenvalues are the principal moments and whose eigenvectors are the principal axes. A qubit
far from an axis and easy to disturb contributes heavily to the moment about that axis; one sitting
on the axis contributes nothing to it however easy it is to disturb. The word rotational means that
and only that here, and it is the standard definition and not an analogy.

A SPHERICAL ARRANGEMENT SHOULD COME OUT NEARLY ISOTROPIC, with three similar principal moments,
because no axis is special. A CHAIN SHOULD NOT: its qubits lie along one direction. The moment
about that direction should be far smaller than about the two across it. If those two predictions
fail the tensor is not measuring what it claims.
