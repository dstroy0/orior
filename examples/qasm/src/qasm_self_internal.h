// The self run. A circuit becomes one program for the record machine: every gate is a floor of exact integer steps
// reading the floor below it, and with register reuse each lane runs the whole stack in one launch from its own input
// state. A lane's state is every amplitude's four integer parts, the rational and sqrt2 parts of its real half and then
// of its imaginary half, over one denominator the host keeps. A gate is the integer linear map its matrix makes over
// the least common denominator of its entries. Its columns are the dense port's own action on each basis state. The
// lanes apply exactly the gates the port applies. No step divides and nothing rounds.
