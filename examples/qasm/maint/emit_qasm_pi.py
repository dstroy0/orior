The guard width is read from QASM_GUARD_BITS in qasm_internal.h and never written here. The places are the least p
with 10^p past 2^(G + 1), found in integers: pi cut to p places is then within half a unit of pi * 2^G, and
qasm_fixed_constants takes it the rest of the way. naturals.pi reaches its digits by two routes that have to agree.
