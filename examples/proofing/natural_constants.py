WHY LENGTH MATTERS HERE

The boundary reading is about to be evaluated per pixel instead of per vertex, and the claim being
made for that is not that it is faster: it is that it is exact where the vertex grid is an
approximation. A claim of exactness needs something more accurate than the thing being graded, or
it is only two implementations agreeing with each other.

Every constant the reading uses is a computed number and none of them is a measured one. Pi, the
square root of two, the square root of five, the golden angle and the harmonic normalizations are
all decidable to as many digits as anyone asks for. So the accuracy floor of the whole engine is a
choice about how many digits to carry and never a limit of what is known.

That is worth stating next to the other kind of constant. The 2022 CODATA listing carries a value
and an uncertainty for each of its entries, and about half of them read "(exact)" because the 2019
redefinition of the SI fixed the speed of light, the Planck constant, the elementary charge, the
Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant by definition. The rest -- the fine structure
constant, the gravitational constant, every particle mass -- carry an uncertainty that no amount of
computing will shrink. Nothing in this repository's reading path uses one of those. Confirmed by
search across every source file: no physical constant appears anywhere in the engine.

WHAT PROVES THIS

The strongest check available needs no trusted digit string at all, and it is already published.
SHA-256's sixty-four round constants are defined as the first thirty-two bits of the fractional
parts of the cube roots of the first sixty-four primes, and its eight starting words as the same
thing for the square roots of the first eight primes. So recomputing them from the primes and
comparing against the tables in this tree is a check on two thousand and forty-eight independently
published bits, and arbitrary-precision root code that gets every one of them right is not code
whose roots are slightly wrong.

Pi is checked twice more: against a fifty-digit prefix, and by computing it a second time from a
different formula and requiring the two to agree. Machin's and Euler's arctangent identities share
no term. Agreement between them is not two copies of one mistake.

Integer arithmetic throughout. A root taken as the integer part of a root of a scaled integer is
exact by construction, with no rounding to reason about at any step.
