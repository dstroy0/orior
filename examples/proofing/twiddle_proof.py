WHAT WAS MISSING

A number theoretic transform is a sum of powers of one constant, the root of unity, and the powers
it is evaluated at are the twiddle constants. Every implementation of the transform in wide use
takes them from a table: Kyber's modulus is 3329, Dilithium's is 8380417, and the three thirty-two
bit moduli that general purpose libraries reach for are the same three everywhere. The tables are
copied, and a copied constant is a constant nobody checked.

Ravi, Yang, Bhasin, Zhang and Chattopadhyay show what that is worth. Their fault injection sets the
twiddle constants to zero with a single targeted fault, and the transform does not fail: it returns
a value of the ordinary shape carrying far less entropy than it should, which is enough to recover a
Kyber key and to forge a Dilithium signature. The attack works because nothing downstream can tell
a real root of unity from a fiddled one.

THIS TREE PRODUCED THAT FAULT CONDITION WITH NO ATTACKER. A modulus was taken on faith for the
transform underneath the constants module, its root was raised to the power that is supposed to give
an order 2^27 root of unity, and the result had no such order, because the modulus was not prime. A
generator check written next to it reported the root was fine, having tested trial division to one
hundred on a ten digit number. Wrong twiddles, output of the ordinary shape, and a check that said
yes. That is the paper's fault model arriving by carelessness instead of by electromagnetic pulse,
and it is the reason this file exists.

WHAT IS PROVED HERE, AND WHY IT CAN BE

Every modulus a transform can use has the form k * 2^n + 1, because having a root of
unity of order 2^n means. For that form two complete proofs are available, and neither is a test
that returns a probability.

    PRIMALITY, BY PROTH. For N = k * 2^n + 1 with k odd and k < 2^n, N is prime if and only if some
    a has a^((N-1)/2) congruent to -1 modulo N. A witness is a certificate of primality instead of
    evidence of it. On the other side a single a with a^(N-1) not congruent to 1 is a certificate of
    compositeness by Fermat. So both verdicts are proofs and neither is a judgement call.

    THE ORDER OF THE ROOT, EXACTLY, WITHOUT FACTORING ANYTHING. The order of a root of unity of
    order dividing 2^m is itself a power of two. So it is enough that w^(2^m) is 1 and w^(2^(m-1))
    is not: the order divides 2^m and does not divide 2^(m-1), which leaves exactly 2^m. Two
    exponentiations settle it completely. This is the step the fault attack defeats and it costs
    almost nothing to run.

    THE GENERATOR, COMPLETELY. g generates the whole group if and only if g^((p-1)/q) is not 1 for
    each prime q dividing p-1. Here p-1 is k * 2^n with k small. Factoring it is factoring k, and
    the proof is complete instead of partial.

WHY THE SIZE IS OURS TO CHOOSE

The tabled moduli are small because they are sized to a machine word: a lane holds sixty four bits,
a product of two residues has to fit, and so the modulus stops below 2^32. That is a property of the
lane and not of the mathematics. The arithmetic here is on unbounded integers. Proth's proof runs
at any width, and moduli far past anything tabled can be produced and proved on demand. The floor
belongs to the format, which is this tree's own finding, and the format is a choice.

WHAT IT ERRORS

A modulus outside Proth's range, where k is not below 2^n. The theorem's converse is the step that
makes a witness a proof and it does not hold there. A root whose order is short of the length asked
for, the fiddled twiddle exactly. And any verdict without its certificate: every answer
below carries the witness that establishes it. The reader can recheck the claim without rerunning
this file.
