"""Point the validated relation search at real constants, across a grid of parameters.

The pipeline is gated in both directions: it recovers a planted relation exactly, it rejects a false
one found among unrelated numbers, and it rediscovers the 1996 BBP formula for pi. So it can be
pointed somewhere and its answers read.

WHERE NOT TO POINT IT

Borwein, Galway and Borwein proved in 2004 that pi has no degree-one BBP formula in a power-of-two
base beyond the three already known. That region is closed and searching it only rediscovers what is
there. So the grid covers powers two and three, which are far less swept, and constants besides pi.

WHAT A HIT WOULD AND WOULD NOT BE

A believable relation here is a CANDIDATE formula instead of a discovery. Most of the space is either
empty or already in Bailey's compendium, and anything that survives the screen has to be checked
against it before it is called new. The screen guarantees only that the relation is not an
artifact of finite precision, the part that is easy to get wrong and hard to notice.
