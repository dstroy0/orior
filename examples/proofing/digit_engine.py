WHAT WAS MISSING

`natural_constants.py` computes pi, the roots, the golden angle, the harmonic unit and SHA-256's own
tables at any precision asked for. Every one of them bottoms out on a series summed one term at a
time, and the shape of that summation stops them. The size of the answer does not.

MEASURED. `pi_machin` takes 0.002 s at a thousand places and 0.045 s at four thousand. The Gregory
series does a term per digit of output and each term costs a division at the full working precision.
The cost is the square of the digit count. Extrapolated to a billion digits that is on the order
of ninety years, and no amount of care inside the loop changes the exponent.

The ceiling was never a property of pi. It belonged to the shape of the sum.

WHAT REPLACED IT

Binary splitting on Chudnovsky's series. The linear sum divides at every term at full precision;
binary splitting carries three exact integers per interval and merges pairs. There is exactly ONE
division in the whole computation and it happens at the end. Nothing in between is rounded. There
is no error to propagate and no tolerance to argue about: the intermediates are integers and they
are exact.

Chudnovsky gains 14.18 decimal digits per term against Machin's roughly 1.4. The term count falls
by ten before the shape of the sum is even considered.

WHERE THE HOST STOPS, AND WHY THAT IS THE HONEST NUMBER

The multiply underneath is Python's own, which is Karatsuba: measured at 0.930 s for a million
digits and 5.610 s for three million, an exponent of 1.635. Binary splitting turns the series into
some tens of multiplies at the full size. The reachable range follows directly from that exponent
and is reported by `--time` instead of promised here.

THE TRANSFORM IS WIRED IN, BEHIND `--device`. It lowers the exponent to N log N and it runs on the
card, over three moduli that each carry a Proth certificate and a proved twiddle order from
`twiddle_proof.py`. Measured on the empty message: a million places takes 53.4 s on the host and
19.3 s through the card, and both routes end on the same ten digits.

The gain is smaller than the multiply's own, and the reason is worth stating plainly. A
million digit run does most of its work in the LOWER levels of the splitting tree, where the
operands are small and the native multiply is the faster route; only the top few levels are large
enough for the transform to pay for its own setup. So the speedup grows with the digit count as
more levels cross that line, and quoting the multiply's ratio as the series' ratio would be
comparing two different quantities.

The threshold itself is measured and lives in `gpu_multiply.NATIVE_LIMBS`.

WHAT IT ERRORS

A result that has not been put next to an independent one. Every digit count checked below is
computed twice, once here and once by the module that was already trusted, and agreement is reported
as agreement instead of assumed from a clean run. The published prefix, which came from neither
routine, is the third opinion.
