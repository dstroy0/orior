"""Integer relation detection at whatever precision the engine will carry.

Given real numbers x0 through xn, an integer relation is a vector of integers a0 through an, not all
zero, with

    a0 x0 + a1 x1 + ... + an xn = 0

Finding one turns a set of numbers into a closed form. This is how the BBP formula for pi was found:
Bailey, Borwein and Plouffe computed candidate terms to high precision and searched for a relation
among them, and the relation WAS the formula. Nothing about the method is specific to pi.

WHY PRECISION IS THE WHOLE GAME

A relation whose coefficients run to D digits cannot be seen at less than about D times n digits of
input, because below that the lattice cannot tell a true relation from an accidental one. That makes
this a precision-bound search and not a time-bound one. Precision is the single axis where an engine
with no floor under it buys something that more cores do not.

It also makes the failure mode sharp and worth stating: at insufficient precision the search returns
relations that are ARTIFACTS, small integer combinations that happen to cancel in the digits
available and diverge past them. So every candidate here is re-evaluated at the full input precision
and reported with the size of its residual, and a relation whose residual is not far below the
precision it was found at is rejected instead of reported.

THE METHOD

An integer-preserving LLL on the lattice whose rows are

    ( 1 0 ... 0   round(M x0) )
    ( 0 1 ... 0   round(M x1) )
    ( ...                     )
    ( 0 0 ... 1   round(M xn) )

for a large multiplier M. A short vector in that lattice has a small last coordinate, which is
exactly a small value of the combination, and its first n coordinates are the coefficients. The
reduction is done in integers throughout - no float appears anywhere in the search, which matters
the search has to work below the depth where a float has anything left.
