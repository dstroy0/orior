"""Search for BBP-type formulas, gated by rediscovering one that is already known.

Bailey's compendium states the method exactly. A BBP-type formula for a constant alpha has the form

    alpha = (1/r) sum over k of (1/b^k) times sum over j=1..n of a_j / (kn + j)^s

so to hunt one, compute alpha and the n auxiliary sums

    x_j = sum over k of 1 / (b^k (kn + j)^s)

to high precision, and look for an integer relation among the n+1 values. A relation IS the formula.

WHY THE CONTROL COMES FIRST

A relation search returns a vector for any input whatever, because at finite precision large enough
integers always cancel something. The screening in relation_search rejects those, but a screen that
has never been shown passing a true formula is worth nothing - the lesson of every other
instrument in this tree tonight.

So the pipeline is aimed first at pi with b=16, s=1, n=8, where the answer has been known since 1996:

    pi = sum over k of (1/16^k) (4/(8k+1) - 2/(8k+4) - 1/(8k+5) - 1/(8k+6))

If the search does not return (4, 0, 0, -2, -1, -1, 0, 0) up to sign and scale, nothing it says
about an unexplored constant means anything.

WHERE NOT TO LOOK

Borwein, Galway and Borwein proved in 2004 that pi has no degree-1 BBP formulas in a base that is a
power of two beyond the three already known. That region is closed, and searching it would only
rediscover what is there.
