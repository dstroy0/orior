"""How large a Proth prime this engine can certify end to end, measured and not assumed.

    python examples/proofing/proth_reach.py --check       grade against twiddle_proof at small size
    python examples/proofing/proth_reach.py --reach        climb until one certificate is too slow
    python examples/proofing/proth_reach.py --k 5 --n 100000   certify one candidate, timed

WHAT THIS MEASURES

A Proth certificate is one modular exponentiation: `a^((N-1)/2) mod N`, which is prime exactly when
it is `-1`. So the size of prime this engine can prove is the size of exponentiation it can run,
and that size is set by the multiply underneath. Below about a thousand limbs the host's own
multiply is faster; above it the products go to the card. This file walks the candidate size upward
and reports the wall clock of one certificate at each. The reach is a measured number and not a
projection.

The candidates are real. `k * 2^n + 1` with `k` small and odd is the exact form the record hunts
use, and the same form every NTT modulus has. The search is the same one anyone runs; the only
difference is the multiply it stands on.

WHAT IT IS NOT

It is not a record attempt. The record Proth primes are millions of digits and take a native GPU
exponentiation days to weeks; this engine still marshals each product through the host between
device calls. It reaches far less. That gap is the honest state of the tool, and the number this
prints is where it actually stands today.
