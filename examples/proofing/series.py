"""The numerics, written once, with the multiply handed in.

An ENGINE here is one function: `product(left, right)`, and the interface stops there. Everything in
this module - reciprocals, roots, division, modular exponentiation, Chudnovsky's series - is built
from multiplies and shifts. Naming the multiply therefore names the machine, and no second
declaration is needed anywhere.

WHY THE MULTIPLY IS PASSED IN INSTEAD OF BOUND GLOBALLY

Two other arrangements each fail the same way, and neither may be used.

One is a module-level `product` rebound by a `use_device()` call. Any tool that calls it
changes the arithmetic of every other tool in the process, from anywhere, at any time, and a run
cannot be described without knowing the call order. That is a monkeypatch whatever it is named.

The other is two engines each carrying their own copy of the recurrences. That removes the
rebinding and buys a worse problem: two copies of a Newton iteration are one edit away from
disagreeing, and nothing reports it when they do - the results simply differ and both look fine.

Passing the multiply in has neither failure. There is one copy of each recurrence, the caller's
import line picks the machine, and the choice is visible at the call instead of hidden in the
call order of the process.

    import digit_engine    then digit_engine.chudnovsky(n)    every multiply on the host
    import device_engine   then device_engine.chudnovsky(n)   every multiply on the card

Both bind this module. Neither can change the other's arithmetic, because there is no global here
to change.

NOTHING DIVIDES AT SIZE. Every division below is a Newton reciprocal whose base case runs sixty
four bits past the divisor's width, where a host does it in one machine instruction. Above that
base case there are only multiplies and shifts. That is the property making the engine
substitutable at all: a card that can multiply can run every line of this file.

    the true floor and not a value within a tolerance of it.
