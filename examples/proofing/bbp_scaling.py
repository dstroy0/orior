"""How the relation search costs scale with precision, and where the cost actually sits.

WHY MEASURE BEFORE GOING DEEPER

The search is precision-bound: a relation whose coefficients run to D digits cannot be seen below
about D*n digits of input. So "run it deeper" is the whole strategy, and the open question is
matters is what deeper costs. A run at 40,000 binary places spent twenty-three minutes of CPU on the
CONTROL CELL ALONE and had not finished it - and the grid is 240 cells. That is ninety hours for one
sweep, which is not a depth, it is a wall.

Guessing a smaller number would repeat the mistake. This measures the exponent instead.

WHAT IT SEPARATES

Two costs grow at different rates and only one of them is the arithmetic:

    the multiply         grows with the precision, and is the cost the engine exists to lower
    the REDUCTION        grows with how many times the lattice swaps, and each swap in
                         `reduce_lattice` recomputes the ENTIRE Gram-Schmidt from scratch

The second is a property of the implementation instead of the problem. Textbook LLL updates the
coefficients incrementally on a swap; this one throws them away and rebuilds, which is O(n^3) inner
products every time. If that term dominates, buying a faster multiply or a bigger card does nothing
at all, and the fix is in the reduction.

So this counts multiplies as well as timing them. A cost that is many cheap multiplies and a cost
that is few expensive ones need opposite repairs, and a stopwatch alone cannot tell them apart.
