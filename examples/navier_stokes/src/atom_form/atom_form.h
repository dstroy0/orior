// An atom is a number held apart and never evaluated: w(z_c) and w'(z_c) for the Kummer solution, z_c^h, E1(x). e is
// held apart from every atom: each term carries its own rational power of e, and e^p e^q is e^(p+q) exactly;
// e^(-1/s_c), e^N and e^(-n/b) are one number at three powers. A form is a sum of rational coefficients times e^q times
// products of atoms. The exponent of atom i in a term is entry i of its power, trailing zeros dropped; one product has
// one key.
