// The subject is a form at a point of 3 rational parameters. Corner b = b_0 + 2 b_1 + 4 b_2 sits at

// written as the same three bits, is
//     c_S = (1/8) sum over the corners of f(corner) times the product over a in S of s_a,
// and f(corner) = sum over S of c_S times that product, exactly: c_0 is the value, c_1, c_2 and c_4 the edge
// differences, c_3, c_5 and c_6 the face differences, and c_7 the body difference. Each term the subject holds at any
// corner is marked with the components holding it: the count of those is the term's character, recorded as it is.
