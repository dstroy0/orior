# Ask the period detector for a subtraction game's Grundy period, on every move set in a sweep, with
# the answer to each row computed separately and exactly.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/game_theory/4_measure/grundy_period.py [largest move] [most moves]
#
# This exists to close a hole the workbook names in its own words. Every reach claim in this work is
# empirical, quantified over a set nobody has enumerated, and the workbook states that getting from
# a list of instances to a statement about a domain takes a controlled series inside that domain
# with an outside answer attached, which it then says is years of work because obtaining the rows
# costs money and a database.
#
# Impartial games remove the cost. A subtraction game with a finite move set has an eventually
# periodic Grundy sequence, proved, and the period is a quantity a dull exact routine computes by
# comparison. A row is free, the number of rows is a choice, and no row's answer came from the
# detector being tested. This subject is for that.
#
# The detector is `measure.periodicity.sequence_period` and the crystallography chapter
# uses it on cell edges. It knows nothing about games. It is handed a list of small integers.
#
# One rule has to be respected and it is the detector's own. A period is scored against its
# multiples. A period beyond half the window has a family of one inside the window and is the
# single tallest lag again. Rows whose true period exceeds half the window are therefore out of
# range by construction and are counted separately instead of as failures.
