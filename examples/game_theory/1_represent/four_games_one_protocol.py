# Four games carrying their own answer key, behind one protocol that knows none of them apart.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/game_theory/1_represent/four_games_one_protocol.py
#
# What a game keeps and what it throws away. A position here is a tuple: a board, whose turn it is,
# and whatever else the rules need to say what happens next. Nothing is remembered about how the
# position was reached, because nothing in the rules depends on it -- except the things that do, and
# those are in the state explicitly. Castling rights are in the chess state for that reason, and so
# is the en passant square. A state that needs history is a state that was not written down properly.
#
# The four differ in the two properties that decide whether the outcome distribution can be computed
# or only estimated: whether chance deals, and whether the opponent chooses. Blackjack has chance and
# no opponent choice. Checkers has opponent choice and no chance. Poker has both. Chess has only
# opponent choice and is far too large regardless. Those four corners are why these four games.
