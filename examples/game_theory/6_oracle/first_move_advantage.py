# The first move, read as a per-player winning-path entropy, and why the exact answer is a
# tablebase instead of a search.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/game_theory/6_oracle/first_move_advantage.py
#
# THE QUESTION. Does the side that moves first have an advantage? The move-sequence tree is the
# wrong place to look: it is unbounded, and a bounded search folds a horizon into the number. This
# subject errors exactly that. The question is put as a magnitude instead.
#
# THE WINDICATOR. Each player carries one number, its winning-path mass: the probability that play
# from this position reaches THAT player's win, an exact rational in native integers, in [0, 1]. It closes to 1 as a win
# becomes forced and rests at 0 when no winning path survives. A winning path bottoms out where the
# opponent has no legal move (checkmate is verdict()==WIN/LOSS with no reply). The two windicators
# are separate state, one per player, from PLAYER_ONE's and PLAYER_TWO's own side.
#
# WHY THE MAGNITUDE ALONE CANNOT ANSWER IT. The sum of the two windicators is invariant under
# swapping the players; the first-move advantage is ODD under that swap -- give the move to the other
# side and the advantage flips sign. A quantity that is odd under a symmetry is invisible to any
# quantity that is even under it. So the advantage lives in the SIGNED difference V(side to move)
# minus V(if the other side moved), never in the magnitude. This is the same fact a reflection-
# invariant magnitude has about chirality: it is exact for what the symmetry preserves and blind to
# what the symmetry flips.
#
# WHY THE TREE IS FINITE WITHOUT A HORIZON. Real tournament rules end a non-progressing line by the
# game's OWN rule, not by a depth cap the analyst chose: threefold repetition (the rule for a draw of
# exactly this cyclic type), the fifty-move rule, and insufficient material. A line that engine
# chess.py leaves UNRESOLVED forever coalesces to an exact DRAW under these. That is not bounding: the
# rule belongs to chess, it is reported, and it is the same for every position.
#
# WHAT IS EXACT HERE AND WHAT IS NOT. The windicator on a fully resolved position is an exact
# rational. The bare-kings draw is exact by insufficient material. The repetition draw is exact. What
# is NOT delivered here is the exact windicator of a full king-and-pawn or king-and-rook ending: that
# is a retrograde solve over the coalesced position graph -- a tablebase -- because forward search
# explodes and a plain negamax memo is unsound once repetition makes a value depend on the path that
# reached it. That solve is named as the open work in theory/workbooks/orior, not folded into a number here.
