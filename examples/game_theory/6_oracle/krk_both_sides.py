# The exact predictor plays BOTH sides of K+R vs K to a real, played-out win and loss.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/game_theory/6_oracle/krk_both_sides.py
#           (about half a minute: it solves the whole K+R vs K class, folded by symmetry.)
#
# WHAT THIS SHOWS. The tablebase of the previous example gives a value per position. This one lets
# that exact predictor MOVE. It solves K+R vs K for win/draw/loss and distance to mate, then plays a
# game out with the predictor choosing for BOTH sides: the winning side takes the move with the
# smallest distance to mate, the losing side the largest. The win is forced and the defense is the
# longest legal one. The moveset printed is a real game -- legal moves to a terminal position -- and
# its length must equal the distance to mate the solve reported. That equality is the check: the
# static value and the played-out game are two routes to the same number.
#
# K+R vs K is the class where this closes cleanly: it is a forced win for the rook's side, there is no
# pawn and so no promotion, and the whole game stays in the class until mate. The move-sequence source
# here is the game itself instead of an outside record: the repository holds no game corpus. The real
# movesets are the ones the exact predictor plays, from a real starting position, not pulled from a
# database of human games. Comparing the predictor against human play would need such a corpus.
#
# HOW IT STAYS EXACT AND INTEGER ONLY. Value is win, draw or loss as the integers 2, 1, 0; distance to
# mate is an integer count of plies; the eight board symmetries fold the position graph to its classes
# without a pawn to break them. No fractions, no math library, no outside library: retrograde over the
# coalesced graph, and the tournament rules give a draw where neither side can force progress.
