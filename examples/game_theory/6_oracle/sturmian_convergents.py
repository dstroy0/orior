# What the period detector returns when it is handed a sequence that has no period, and why the
# number it returns is not arbitrary.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/game_theory/6_oracle/sturmian_convergents.py
#
# Wythoff's losing positions sit on a line of slope phi. The gaps between successive ones form a
# Sturmian word, which is aperiodic: that is not a measurement, it follows from phi being irrational.
# Handed that word, sequence_period returns 8, then 13, then 21, then 34, then 55, as the window
# widens. Those are Fibonacci numbers, and the Fibonacci numbers are the denominators of the
# continued fraction convergents of phi.
#
# So the detector does not fail at random and it is not reading noise. Every margin here clears its
# own shuffle floor by six to nine times. A rotation by an irrational really does agree with itself
# at the denominator of any good rational approximation to that irrational, and the detector is
# reporting that agreement correctly. The name on the output is false. "Period" is the wrong
# word for it, and the workbook's crystallography rows are safe only because a lattice has a period
# for the reported number to be.
#
# The generalization is the falsifiable part and it is what this script tests. If the mechanism is
# continued fractions then the reported number should be a convergent denominator of the slope for
# any irrational slope, phi among them. Nine slopes, seven windows each.
#
# The diagnostic that comes out of it needs no oracle at all. A true period is the same number at
# every window. These are not: none of the nine slopes gives one answer across all seven windows,
# and 115 of 115 subtraction games with a real period do.
