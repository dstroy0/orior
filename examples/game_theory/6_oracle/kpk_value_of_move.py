# The value of the move in K+P vs K, solved exactly, checked against published endgame theory.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/game_theory/6_oracle/kpk_value_of_move.py
#           (slow: it solves the whole K+P vs K class, about two to three minutes.)
#
# THE CLAIM. First-move advantage is not a constant. In the smallest ending where the move is not
# a formality, K+P vs K, the value of the move -- White's result with the move minus White's result
# if the other side had to move -- is positive in some positions, zero in most, and NEGATIVE in the
# opposition, where being the side to move throws away the win. This file proves it by solving the
# class and reading the value of the move off the table.
#
# HOW IT IS SOLVED, WITHOUT A HORIZON. Win, draw and loss are found by retrograde fixed point over
# the coalesced position graph: a node is a win if one move reaches an opponent loss, a loss if every
# move reaches an opponent win, and a draw otherwise -- the draw case being every position that can
# force neither, the draw the repetition and fifty-move rules give. Promotion leaves the
# class: a queen or rook is a win unless it stalemates or is captured into bare kings, an
# underpromotion to a minor is an insufficient-material draw. No depth is folded into any value.
#
# THE ORACLE. Five positions with a result known from endgame theory are checked against the table:
# the direct opposition with the pawn on the fifth (a draw for the side to move), the king on the
# sixth in front of the pawn (a win whoever moves), the defender far (a win whoever moves), the
# defender in front with the attacker behind (a draw whoever moves), and the rook pawn in the corner
# (the drawn fortress). The table must reproduce all five, and it does.
#
# THE DISTRIBUTION. Beyond the five oracle positions, the value of the move is tallied over the whole
# class: the boards where having the move helps White, changes nothing, or hurts White (the zugzwang
# and opposition band). It takes every sign. The claim is exact -- first-move advantage is a
# per-position quantity instead of a constant.
