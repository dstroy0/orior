# The hadrons the light quarks make, and the integer charge a color-neutral combination forces.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/1_represent/hadrons_from_quarks.py
#
# The quarks come from the ledger, the light three u, d and s that make the common hadrons. A baryon is
# three quarks and a meson is a quark and an antiquark, the color-neutral combinations, and this takes
# each one's charge as the exact sum in thirds. Nothing is derived about why quarks bind or what a
# hadron weighs. The charge is an integer sum and it is read as one, with no mass and no tolerance.
#
# What comes out is that every color-neutral combination carries an integer charge, a multiple of three
# thirds, where a single quark carries a fraction. That is confinement stated in charge alone: the free
# thing is the integer-charged one. The observed charges fall out, the proton at +1, the neutron at 0
# and the omega at -1, and the proton balancing the electron is the reason a hydrogen atom is neutral,
# the thread back to the first stage of this subject.
#
# The arithmetic is integer only, charge carried in thirds, with no library and no rounding. Source: the
# Particle Data Group at CERN, for the quark content of each named hadron.
