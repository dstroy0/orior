# The Bohr orbit of one electron as exact rationals, and a trajectory reproduces with no rounding.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/1_represent/an_orbit_as_exact_rationals.py [Z | symbol ...]
#
# A hydrogen-like ion is one electron on a nucleus of charge Z. Bohr quantizes its angular momentum at
# an integer multiple of hbar, and the orbit that follows has radius n^2/Z in units of the Bohr radius
# and energy -Z^2/n^2 in units of the Rydberg. Both are exact rationals: an integer over an integer,
# with nothing to round. The quantum number n is an exact integer. Two orbits n and n+1 differ by
# (2n+1)/Z exactly and never merge, however large n gets. That is the trajectory reproduced with the
# infinite discrimination exact arithmetic gives, and it is why a float, which loses the gap between
# large orbits, is the wrong tool for it.
#
# The arithmetic here is integer rationals done by hand, add, subtract, multiply and compare, the host
# stand-in for the fixed-width limb integers in no_rounding on the device arm. No float and no bignum
# library sits in the path, the same discipline representation/exact.py keeps for decimal coordinates.
#
# Everything is carried in the natural units, the Bohr radius and the Rydberg. No measured constant
# enters and no digit is approximate. The absolute size of an orbit in meters, and any comparison to a
# measured spectral line, needs the Rydberg constant, which is measured and cited, and that is the
# oracle stage and not this one. What is exact and physical-constant-free is the shape: the ratios.
# Within one spectral series the constant cancels, and a line ratio is a pure rational the model
# predicts with no measurement in it, for a later oracle to hold a measured ratio against.
