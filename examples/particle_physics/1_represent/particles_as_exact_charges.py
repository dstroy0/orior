# The Standard Model particles as exact charges, and the structure the exact numbers emit on their own.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/1_represent/particles_as_exact_charges.py
#
# The particles and their masses come from the Particle Data Group, hosted at CERN, and are represented
# in representation/particle/standard_model.py by exact integer quantum numbers, charge in thirds and
# spin doubled. This reads the structure back out. Nothing is derived from first principles here: the
# particles are put in, and what emerges is how the exact numbers organize themselves.
#
# The reading is by equality and by exact sums, never by a bound. No mass enters, because a mass forces
# a tolerance and a tolerance is the decision this errors. Two particles carry the same charge or
# they do not; a generation's charges sum to zero or they do not; a charge divides by three or it does
# not. Every question is truthy or falsy, and the census ranks by magnitude, total minus a count, the
# rarest first, the same way the sift kernel probes a field.
#
# Three things emerge. The three generations recur with identical quantum numbers. The up, charm and
# top quarks are one signature seen three times, as the periodic table's groups were one signature seen
# down a column. The electric charge of a generation, each quark counted in its three colors, sums to
# exactly zero, the anomaly-free condition and the reason an atom is neutral: the proton's quarks and
# the electron balance to the digit. And the free particles, the leptons and the bosons, carry a charge
# that divides by three, an integer charge, while the quarks do not, and a quark is never seen alone.
