# Each element becoming its electrons as points carrying values, with no quantum imposed on the state.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/1_represent/an_atom_as_exact_shells.py [Z | symbol ...]
#
# The ledger is read from representation.atom.element, the one transcribed element table. This file is
# the reading over it: it prints what each reading keeps and what it throws away.
#
# The crystallography reader put every site on a 0.25 angstrom grid on the way in, and the recovered
# cell edge then carried the grid instead of the deposit. An atom has the same failure available. An
# electron sits at a quantum state, four numbers: principal, azimuthal, magnetic, spin. A reader that
# keeps only the subshell, the first two, drops the magnetic and spin numbers that tell two electrons
# of one subshell apart.
#
# This reads each element both ways. The exact reading places Z electrons at Z distinct states. The
# subshell reading keeps only the subshell, and a filled 2p then arrives as one address holding six
# electrons where the exact reading holds six.
#
# The difference is a count, and only a count. Both readings agree on the value every electron carries,
# its subshell, and a check that compares values sees nothing: exact.contested returns empty on the
# collapsed reading because the six electrons of a 2p all say "2p" and none disagrees. The loss is in
# the cardinality alone, and exact.placed, a dict, is where the six become one without a word. The
# count is the only place it shows. This reading counts the states and does not lean on the labels
# to disagree. Two electrons at one state is a Pauli violation, and it shows only in the count.
#
# The filling read here is the ideal, Madelung order and Hund's rule, as element.electrons builds it.
# Real atoms deviate, and those measured configurations are the oracle stage, not this one. The
# differentiating electron's group signature recurs down the table, and that recurrence is the periodic
# law the measure stage reads. It is not read here. This stage writes each element down.
