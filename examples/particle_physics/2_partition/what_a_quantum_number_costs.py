# The accumulated electrons read at each quantum number, and what each partition agglomerates.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/2_partition/what_a_quantum_number_costs.py [Z | symbol ...]
#
# A partition is the unit and the scale the points are read at, and a reading is undetermined until it
# is fixed. For an atom the partition is which of the four quantum numbers the reading keeps. Keep all
# four and every electron is its own state, the finest the atom is written at, and no two electrons
# agglomerate. Drop the spin and the two electrons of an orbital fall to one bucket. Drop the magnetic
# number and a subshell's electrons fall together. Drop the principal number and the whole atom is one
# bucket.
#
# The capacity at each level is what Pauli allows there: one electron per spin-orbital, two per orbital,
# 2(2l+1) per subshell, 2n^2 per shell. Those numbers are read off the accumulation here instead of put in.
# The max bucket at a partition is the fullest that level's cell ever gets, and it lands on the Pauli
# capacity because the ideal filling packs each cell before opening the next.
#
# Only the full partition keeps every element's electrons distinct. Every coarser partition
# agglomerates, and the count of what it folds is what the coarse reading costs. Exact arithmetic is
# the full partition: infinite discrimination is the reading that never merges two states that differ,
# and it is why an accumulation of fermions stays an accumulation here instead of collapsing.
