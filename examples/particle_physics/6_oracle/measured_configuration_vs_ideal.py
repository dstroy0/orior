# The ideal Madelung filling held against the published ground states. The aufbau exceptions are read
# and not asserted.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/6_oracle/measured_configuration_vs_ideal.py
#
# The represent stage carries the ideal filling, Madelung order under Hund's rule, and says it is the
# model. This is the measurement it is held against: the ground-state configurations from the NIST
# Atomic Spectra Database, fetched by utils/maint/data/fetch/fetch_nist_ground_states.py. Where a real atom
# fills against the order, the two disagree, and that disagreement is an aufbau exception the oracle
# reports and not a list this file carries.
#
# Two routes meet here. The ideal is derived from a rule; the measurement is someone else's number. The
# noble gases and most other elements agree, the positive control: a comparison where nothing
# agreed would be a broken reading and not a table of exceptions. The measured configuration is checked
# to account for exactly Z electrons before it is compared. A parse that lost an electron errors
# and never counted as an exception.
#
# NIST measures neutral atoms to element 108, hassium. For 109 to 118 no neutral atom has been measured,
# only ions or nothing. Those ten carry the predicted relativistic configurations instead, marked
# predicted and kept apart from the measured ones. A check that covers all 118 has to say which rows are
# measured and which are predicted, or it reads a prediction as a measurement.
