# The rarest signature as an anchor, and the one candidate period a necessary condition leaves standing.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/5_sift/rarest_anchor_narrows_the_period.py
#
# A sift is a necessary condition over an index set. A period is a difference between two things that
# agree, the reading the measure stage rests on. If the sequence has period d then every signature
# that appears sits at two places d apart: d is a difference within that signature's positions. The
# necessary condition for a period is therefore that d belong to the difference set of every signature,
# and the candidates are the lags common to every one of those difference sets. It is all equality, a
# lag either is a difference or it is not, and no tolerance is chosen anywhere.
#
# The anchors are applied by census magnitude, the total less a count, the rarest first, the order the
# sift kernel probes a field in. The rarest signatures are the f-block ones, each at exactly two places,
# the lanthanide and the actinide of one column, thirty two apart. A signature at two places has a
# difference set of one lag. The rarest anchor cuts the candidates to a single lag in one step, where
# a common anchor would leave many. The magnitude ordering buys that, and it is the steering the
# whole subject holds to: magnitude and equality, and never a bound.
#
# The one surviving candidate is 32, the lanthanide-actinide repeat and the longest row. It is not an
# exact period: the sufficiency check below reads the sequence at that lag and finds hydrogen against
# gallium at the first place. The table has no period, the result the measure stage read from the
# other side. The necessary condition still did its work, and the rare anchor did most of it.
