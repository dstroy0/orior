# A decay passes only where its conserved integers balance, the necessary condition read by equality.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/5_sift/decays_pass_the_conservation_laws.py
#
# A sift is a necessary condition, and conservation is one: a decay can happen only where the electric
# charge, the baryon number and the lepton number of the products equal the parent's. Each of the
# three is an exact integer, charge and baryon carried in thirds. The check is a sum and an equality,
# a decay balances or it does not, with no tolerance and no mass. Whether a balanced decay is fast or
# slow, or happens at all, is dynamics this does not read; conservation is only the gate every decay
# has to pass.
#
# The fundamental particles' numbers come from the ledger. The antiparticles negate theirs, and the few
# composite hadrons carry the numbers their quark content gives, cited to the Particle Data Group. The
# decays themselves are the measured channels, one of them a channel never seen: a proton to a positron
# and a photon, which balances the charge and breaks the baryon number. The gate closes on it, and the
# proton's stability is that closed gate read in integers.
#
# Integer arithmetic only, in thirds, with no library and no rounding.
