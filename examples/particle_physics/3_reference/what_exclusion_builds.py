# The periodic recurrence measured against two backgrounds, one keeping the counts and one keeping no
# exclusion. What Pauli builds is read as the departure from what it does not.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/3_reference/what_exclusion_builds.py
#
# A reference is the background a signal is read against, built by deleting a property from the data.
# Two are drawn here.
#
# The first keeps the census and deletes the order. reference.shuffles.permuted draws a uniform
# arrangement of the same signatures. Every count is exactly preserved and only the accumulation
# order is gone. It is the least committal background consistent with the histogram, and it cannot be
# wrong about the counts because it is the counts. If the recurrence is in the order it falls to the
# floor here; if it is in the census it survives.
#
# The second keeps no exclusion. Fermions accumulate into successive states because Pauli forbids two
# in one; delete that and every electron drops to 1s, and an element is then only a count of electrons
# in one state, with nothing to recur. Its signatures are all distinct, one per element, and its match rate
# is the floor of a set with no repeats. This is the background Doug named: we accumulate here because
# exactness gives infinite discrimination, and Pauli turns that accumulation into shells. Remove the
# exclusion and the table is a ladder.
#
# The positive control is the real accumulation, Madelung order under Hund's rule, and it is the only
# arm carrying the recurrence at 8, 18 and 32 that the two backgrounds lack.
