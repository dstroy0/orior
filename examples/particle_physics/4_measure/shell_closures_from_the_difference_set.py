# The table read for its period, which is not one number, and the shell closures read off the gaps.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/particle_physics/4_measure/shell_closures_from_the_difference_set.py
#
# The group signatures in atomic number order are a sequence, and the match rate at a lag is how often
# a signature equals the one that many elements ahead. A single period would stand up at one lag and
# its multiples. The periodic table does not: its rows run 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, 32. No one lag
# carries the recurrence, and a reader that reported one period would be wrong for most of the table.
# periodicity.py's header records the same trap from the other side, a period scored against its own
# harmonics; here the harmonics are genuinely different lengths.
#
# What is one number is the gap between closures. A shell closes where a p subshell fills, signature
# (p,6), with helium closing the first row on (s,2). Those closures sit at the noble gases, and the
# differences between them are the row lengths, read off the accumulation with no row told to it. That
# is the crystallography difference-set reading moved to one dimension: a period is a difference
# between two things that agree. The complete candidate set is the differences themselves.
#
# The match rate is read against coincidence_floor, the rate a shuffle of the same signatures reaches
# at any lag. A lag above the floor repeats for a reason the counts do not force; a lag at the floor
# is the census talking to itself. Stage three shuffles and shows the peaks fall to the floor.
