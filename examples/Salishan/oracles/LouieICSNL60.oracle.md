Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 1457 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

The language is ʔayʔaǰuθəm, a.k.a. Comox-Sliammon, Central Salish, and the paper is one narrative
told by Freddie Louie of the Tla’amin Nation on May 17, 2016, with Elsie Paul, recorded,
transcribed, translated and glossed by the seven authors, Freddie Louie first among them.

A turn as said, in Section 2.1, and the words of a line as said, in Section 2.3, are the speaker's:
Freddie Louie for F and Elsie Paul for E, with the English they switch into kept in place. A line of
Section 2.3 said in English only is the speaker's too. The segmentation and gloss lines carry
ʔayʔaǰuθəm, and the English of Section 2.2 and of each glossed line is the authors' translation. The
cited words of Section 1, the prose, the headings and the footnotes carry the authors.

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: æ í č š ƛ ǰ ə ɛ ɩ ɬ ʊ ʔ ʷ ́ ̌
̓ θ χ ᶿ. The line as said is in a practical orthography that writes what Freddie and Elsie say: ɛ,
ɩ, ʊ and æ for lowered and centralized vowels, o, χ for the uvular fricative, ǰ, č, θ, ɬ, ƛ̓ and the
superscript ᶿ of t̓ᶿ. The segmentation writes the underlying forms in a phonemic orthography, i, ə,
u and a for the vowels and x̌ for the uvular, θɛqɛtəm over θiq-it-əm. Affixes take a hyphen, clitics
=, portmanteaus +, infixes angled brackets, reduplication ∼, and an elided segment square brackets,
təq-ipa[n]-t-əm=k̓ʷa.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the page text, read from the glyph positions, through the
same repair: a mark the text sets after a space is put back on its letter, then NFC, then 13
page-read corrections. The glossed lines set each word over its segmentation and gloss, read here by
glyph rows at a 0.112 em word space; the text layer, which sets each column on lines of its own,
settled the tokens the rows read differently, cedar.shakes, NEG ???, <STAT>, and the ‘ of ‘And,
which the glyph stream puts after the A. (101) prints Freddie's words as said in quotes. (56) and
(76) print no time. A footnote mark on a word, gɩǰɛ.2, is noted in the gloss; after a dash, na—6 and
hiɬ-10, it stays on the word. Footnote 13 prints sәnpoliyan with a Cyrillic ә.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 519
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the 7488
distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
