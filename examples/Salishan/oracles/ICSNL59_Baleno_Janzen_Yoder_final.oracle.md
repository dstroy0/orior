Extraction of Acoustic Correlates of Word Stress in Haisla by Grace Baleno, Canada Institute of
Linguistics; Jonathan Janzen, Nicola Valley Institute of Technology; and Brendon Yoder, Canada
Institute of Linguistics and SIL International, ICSNL 59.

Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 19 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

The Haisla words are the authors' own, from recordings made in 2020 in Kitimat with at least six
speakers of the Haisla Nation, and each word of (1) to (4) is given to Haisla with its gloss. The
long vowels, the phonetic values and the phonemes are the authors' notation. Kwak’wala and ’Wùik̓ala
are named as the sister languages, and Wałda̱mas stands in the title of a reference.

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: á é í ú ƛ ɫ ʷ ̄ ̓ λ ḡ. The
examples write the Haisla practical orthography, with p̓, c̓, ɫ, x̄, ḡ and xʷ; λ is the lateral
affricate, as the text layer codes it, and ƛ̓ its glottalized counterpart. Long vowels are written
double, and the stressed syllable carries an acute accent and is set in bold. The phonemes are in
slashes and the phonetic values in square brackets.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the text layer through the same repair: the space the PDF
sets after a stacked mark is closed, except before an opening quote, then NFC, then 1 page-read
correction. The text layer ran the tables and the figure captions into the prose; each is a row of
its own here, the numeric cells kept in reading order. It set a space inside ’Wùik̓ala on page 8,
which the glyph positions and the page set whole.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 122
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the 7594
distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
