Extraction of Clause typing and clitic linearization in Gitksan by Colin Brown, University of
British Columbia, ICSNL 60.

Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 7 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

The language is Gitksan, Interior Tsimshianic, and the examples were elicited from four consultants,
named in footnote * and tagged by initials at the right of a translation: Barbara Sennott (BS),
Jeanne Harris, Vincent Gogag (VG) and Hector Hill (HH). Other examples are cited from Hunt 1993,
Forbes 2018, Brown et al. 2020, Matthewson 2024, Matthewson et al. 2022 and Rigsby 1986, and four
come from stories in Forbes et al. in prep., each tagged with its teller and title.

The who for each tier of an example is Gitksan. The who for a translation is the source its tag
cites, Forbes et al. in prep. for a story, and Colin Brown for an example tagged with a consultant's
initials. The comment under (60) is Vincent Gogag's. The prose, the headings, the displays and the
notes carry Colin Brown.

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: ̱ ̲ ∅. Gitksan is written in
its practical orthography, with ’ for glottalization and the underlined g̲ and k̲ of the story in
(59), U+0332, beside the g̱ of (60), U+0331. The segmentations write the transitive vowel as @. The
gloss labels are ASCII capitals in the text layer.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the page text, read from the glyph positions, through the
same repair: a mark the text sets after a space is put back on its letter, then NFC, then 1
page-read correction. The page text was read by glyph rows, a word space over 0.133 em, and a
smaller gap where a roman word meets an italic one. The trees of (35), (44), (47), (48), (50), (51)
and (52) are given one row for each depth of nodes. The reference to Huijsmans 2023 prints
ʔayʔajuθəm, which the text layer holds as PayPajuθəm, read at 600 dpi.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 469
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the
11182 distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
