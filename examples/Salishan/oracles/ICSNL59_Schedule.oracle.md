Extraction of Program, 59th Annual International Conference on Salish and Neighbouring Languages
(ICSNL) by the ICSNL 59 organizers, UBC Okanagan and the En’owkin Centre, ICSNL 59.

Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 191 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

This is the program of ICSNL 59, a schedule of talks, and none of its words is an example. The
language in it is the names speakers carry in nsyilxcən, the words of talk titles in nsyilxcən,
Secwepemctsín, Nɬeʔkepmxcín and Hul’q’umi’num’, and the names of the languages. Each name and word
is given to the language the program or the talk's own paper names, and the lines of the program to
its organizers.

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: á í ə ɬ ʔ ʷ ̌ ̓. The names and
titles write the practical orthographies of nsyilxcən and Nɬeʔkepmxcín, with k̓, c̓, q̓, x̌, ɬ and
ʔ, and the program once spells Nɬeʔkepmxcín with ł.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the text layer through the same repair: the space the PDF
sets after a stacked mark is closed, except before an opening quote, then NFC. The text layer sets a
space after each glottalized or marked letter of a name, k̓ ɬk̓ əmpíc̓ aʔ and lax̌ lax̌ tkʷ, which
the repair closes; the glyph positions set each name with no gap inside it.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 148
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the 1898
distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
