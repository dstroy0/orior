Extraction of Salish words for ‘black bear’ and ‘grizzly bear’ by Jan P. van Eijk, First Nations
University of Canada, ICSNL 44.

Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 691 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

The forms of the table are each language's as the sources in §3 give them: Kinkade (1991a) for most
languages, Nater for Bella Coola, Timmers for Sechelt, Kuipers for Squamish and Shuswap, Galloway
for Upriver Halkomelem, Nooksack and Samish, Montler for Saanich and Klallam, Hess for Lushootseed,
Thompson and Thompson for Thompson, Mattina for Okanagan, and the author's own research for
Lillooet. The proto-forms are Kinkade's and Kuipers's.

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: á é ê í ó ú č ē ō š ū ƛ ə ɛ ɬ
ʌ ʔ ʷ ˑ ́ ̌ ̓ ̕ ̣ ΄ έ θ ι υ χ ⁱ. The forms are in the Americanist Phonetic Alphabet, standardized by
the author: x̌ for the voiceless uvular fricative, ̕ for glottalization over or after its letter,
k̕ʷ and ƛ̕, ʔ, ɬ, ə, ʷ, the acute of stress, and a period after a prefix, s.čə́txʷn. The pre-APA
forms keep their sources' letters, ′ for stress, ō and ū, ˑ for length, and ι and υ in Tenino k·ι′t
ʷυn.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the text layer through the same repair: the space the PDF
sets after a stacked mark is closed, except before an opening quote, then NFC, then 13 page-read
corrections.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 353
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the 8826
distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
