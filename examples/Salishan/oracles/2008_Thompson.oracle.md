Extraction of Control constructions as a sub-class of nominalized clauses in Upriver Halkomelem by
James J Thompson, UBC, Dept of Linguistics, ICSNL 43.

Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 40 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

The Upriver Halkomelem examples are the author's; the paper thanks Dr. Elizabeth Herrling for
sharing her time and knowledge with the author.

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: á é í ò ó ú. The forms are as
the paper prints them; the glosses are in lower case, det with its subscript set inline, deth.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the page text, read from the glyph positions, through the
same repair: a mark the text sets after a space is put back on its letter, then NFC, then 1
page-read correction. The fonts are CID TrueType subsets with no ToUnicode map; their glyphs are
named by outline, the Times-Roman ones by raster against TeX Gyre Termes, and the paper is read by
glyph rows. The words t á-t and tl éqwel-t print a blank where a glyph of no ink stands, kept as a
space, and the paper prints ?i for the first locative auxiliary.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 216
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the 7378
distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
