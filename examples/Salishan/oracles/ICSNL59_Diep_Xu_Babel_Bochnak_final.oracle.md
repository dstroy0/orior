Extraction of Prosody in Ktunaxa Interrogatives: An Initial Examination of Acoustics and Perception
by Brian Diep, Chenxi Xu, Molly Babel and M. Ryan Bochnak, University of British Columbia, ICSNL 59.

Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 175 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

The Ktunaxa examples were recorded from the authors' consultants, L1 speakers, and each word,
segmentation and gloss is given to Ktunaxa; the translations are the authors'. The wh-words and the
tag of §2.4 are Ktunaxa cited forms, and the Salish languages named for comparison are language
rows.

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: Ȼ ʔ ̓ ⱡ. The examples write
the standardized Ktunaxa orthography of the Kootenai Culture Committee (1999), with ⱡ for [ɬ], ȼ for
[t͡s], ʔ, t̓ and q̓, and a raised dot after a long vowel.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the text layer through the same repair: the space the PDF
sets after a stacked mark is closed, except before an opening quote, then NFC, then 1 page-read
correction. The examples are set word over word, and the page text gives each word, segmentation and
gloss a line; they are read a tier a row. The text layer ran the eight tables and three figure
captions into the prose, and codes the [ɬ] of footnote 1 as ì and drops the tie bar of [t͡s]; the
footnote is read off the page at 400 dpi.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 255
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the
11258 distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
