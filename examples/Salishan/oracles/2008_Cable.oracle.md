Extraction of Covert A-scrambling in Tlingit by Seth Cable, University of Massachusetts, Amherst,
ICSNL 43.

Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 64 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

The Tlingit data are the judgments of the consultants David Katzeek (DK) and John Marks (JM),
gathered at the Sealaska Heritage Institute in December 2007 and May 2008; the Hindi data are cited
from Mahajan (1997).

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: á é í ó ú ̱ ̶ ḵ ∅. The Tlingit
forms are in the practical orthography, x̱, ḵ and g̱ underlined, the acute for high tone; a lowered
digit is a co-reference index, Bill₁, and ∅ a null pronoun.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the page text, read from the glyph positions, through the
same repair: a mark the text sets after a space is put back on its letter, then NFC, then 4
page-read corrections. The fonts are CID TrueType subsets with no ToUnicode map; their glyphs are
named by outline and the paper is read by glyph rows. The trees are written a printed line to a row,
the lone index the glyph rows set under OBJ and t in (18) and under SUBJ in (19) put back on its
node, and a copy struck out on the page carries the long stroke overlay.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 567
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the
14370 distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
