Extraction of 14 Pieces of Spontaneous Discourse in ʔayʔaǰuθəm: Descriptions of Famous Artworks by
Betty Wilson by D. K. E. Reisinger, University of British Columbia, ICSNL 61.

Drafted by the anchor_sift engine and read against the page by a person. The engine sorted every
line of the text layer with english_sift.sorted_into, first against its English reference and the
pure corpus, then against this paper's own English laid over that reference. What the paper's
English did not account for became the example tiers and the cited forms. The alphabet was taken
from the characters that sit outside that English, and word_web.web() built 18343 edges over the
language forms. A person then matched the context: who, kind and gloss for each row, the names,
places and languages, and the notations, read off the page. This file is the control. The reader in
corpus_script_extraction is checked against it, and where they disagree the reader is wrong until
someone reads the paper again and says otherwise.

WHOSE WORDS THESE ARE

Every text is Betty Wilson's, a speaker of the Tla’amin dialect, recorded by Marianne Huijsmans on
July 24, 2023 while Betty described fourteen paintings. The author transcribed, glossed and
translated the texts and checked the hard parts with Betty in follow-up elicitation.

The who for each tier of an example is ʔayʔaǰuθəm. The who for a translation is the author, who
wrote them, and the source cited on its line where one is, as for (2B) of §4.1. The English Betty
spoke between sentences is a speaker comment with Betty Wilson as who. The prose, the notes and the
references carry the author.

THE LETTERS

Outside the paper's English the engine found these letters and marks: Ø á æ í č š ƛ ǰ ə ɛ ɩ ɬ ʊ ʔ ʷ
̆ ̌ ̓ θ χ ᶿ. The orthography line uses the ʔayʔaǰuθəm community orthography with ɛ, ɩ and ʊ, and the
phonemic line writes ə, x̌ and ƛ̓. ᶿ, U+1DBF, is the raised theta of t̓ᶿ.

THE PAGE AND THE TEXT LAYER

The forms are in NFC, and the check puts the text layer through the same repair: the space the PDF
sets after a stacked mark is closed, except before an opening quote, then NFC, then 2 page-read
corrections. The text layer sets a space inside təsqanaməs in the title of Louie et al. 2025, read
off the glyph positions, and in /x̌ʷit/ on page 32. These are the page-read corrections. Betty's
English between sentences and her laughter sit between the numbered sentences, and the check reads
them as notes of the section.

anchor_sift's hand_extraction/oracle_check.py was run on this table through residue.py, leaving out
the notation and symbol note rows, whose form is a label and not a string the paper prints. Of 946
rows asked, 0 hold a form the repaired paper does not, and 0 a form the repair took out. Of the
14364 distinct tokens in the paper, 0 language tokens are held by no row.
