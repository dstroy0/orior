# Put five definitions into one set of sounds, for Section 4.13 of theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/1_represent/to_phonemes.py
#
# Words for sounds came out following the border and not the family, and that was measured on definition.
# definition is the wrong thing for this question: Hungarian writes sz for one consonant and Polish writes
# sz for another. Two words said alike are counted apart and two written alike are counted together.
#
# The dictionary was asked for its transcriptions and does not hold any. Hungarian pages carry a template
# that builds the pronunciation from the definition when the page is drawn, and several Polish pages carry
# nothing at all. That is itself the answer to whether transcriptions would add evidence: they would not,
# because for these five languages the pronunciation is a function of the definition, and a template
# can produce it.
#
# What is still needed is the shared alphabet, and that is a mapping instead of a lookup. Each language's
# definition is turned into the sounds it stands for. A Hungarian s and a Polish sz become the same
# symbol when they are the same consonant and different symbols when they are not.
#
# These mappings are mine. They follow the standard descriptions of each orthography, they are applied
# longest definition first so digraphs are read before their letters, and they ignore length, stress and the
# assimilations that happen across word boundaries. Any error in them is an error in the result, the
# price of not asking a service twelve hundred times.
