#
# Every earlier reading compared different books. A difference between two languages was ala
# difference between an epic and a novel. One text translated into 43 languages removes that: the content
# is the same everywhere. Topic cannot help tell two languages apart and what the web finds is the
# language.
#
# Two things pull against each other here and both are stated because neither can be removed. Holding the
# content fixed takes away a cue the earlier test had, since different books in different languages could
# be told apart partly by being different books. This is the harder test. Against that, one text per
# language has to be cut into pieces to have several samples, and pieces of one translation resemble each
# other more than separate books do, and that makes it easier. The two do not cancel and the number below is
# not directly comparable to the earlier one.
#
# The shape of the answer is comparable: whether the languages that get confused are still the
# related ones, and whether the families still come out, with the content that could have been carrying
# them taken away.
