# Test whether a language reads the same across two different works, for Section 4.13 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/4_measure/cross_corpus.py
#
# Every identification measured so far compares texts to other texts of the same kind: four books of a
# language against each other, or four pieces cut from one translation. Pieces of one translation resemble
# each other for reasons that have nothing to do with the language, and the 83.1 percent measured
# that way was reported as inflated and not comparable.
#
# Two different works translated into the same languages remove that entirely. A language's reading from
# one work is matched against every language's reading from the other, and the two share neither sentence,
# topic nor translator. Nothing is left to carry a match except the language.
#
# This is the strictest test available here and the one the earlier numbers were standing in for. A
# reading that belongs to a language survives it. A reading that belongs to a book cannot.
