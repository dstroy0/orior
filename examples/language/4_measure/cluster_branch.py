# Find out whether the case branch can be gated by a group or has to be gated by a table, for Section
# 4.13 of theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/4_measure/case_or_splitting.py   (writes build/case_branch.csv)
#           python examples/language/4_measure/cluster_branch.py
#
# A branch worth taking in some languages and not others has to be gated on something, and there are two
# shapes the gate can take. A table carries one row per language and costs a lookup. A group test carries
# one row per group and costs less, and it only works if the languages actually fall into groups.
#
# So the question is whether they do. The languages are clustered on what the branch costs and what it
# buys, which are the two numbers the gate decides from, and on how much ambiguity was left for it to
# work on. Joining the two closest, then the two closest groups, until one remains gives a tree, and the
# cophenetic correlation says whether that tree represents the distances or was invented from them. A
# tree with a low cophenetic correlation means there are no groups to test and the gate has to be a table.
#
# The three numbers are put on the same footing first. Vocabulary growth runs to ten percent, what the
# branch buys runs to nine hundredths, and clustering them as they stand would let the larger number
# decide everything. Each is centered on its own average and divided by its own scatter.
#
# The family each language belongs to is checked separately and directly, because the proposal was
# a family gate. If families were the groups, the spread inside a family would be small against
# the spread across all of them. That comparison needs no clustering and does not depend on the linkage.
#
# What this cannot see: nineteen languages is a small number to cluster, one join changes everything
# above it, and the heights are printed, and that makes a join that barely won visible. Two of the corpora hold
# only twenty thousand tokens against sixty thousand for the rest, and their numbers carry that.
