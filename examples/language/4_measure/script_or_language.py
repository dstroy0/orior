# Ask whether the reading follows the language or the writing, with one held fixed at a time, for
# Section 4.13 of theory/workbooks/orior.

#
# Every earlier test moved both at once. Dravidian changed the script and kept the family, Uralic changed
# the contact and kept the descent, and neither could say which of the two the reading was answering.
# Chinese holds one fixed at a time.
#
# Simplified and traditional are one language written in two character sets. The words are the same, the
# grammar is the same, and a reader of one can often not read the other on sight. That is a change of
# writing with no change of language, and both sides come from the same software translations so the
# subject matter is fixed as well. That makes it the cleanest comparison available here.
#
# Cantonese against Mandarin is the other half, two languages that are not mutually intelligible and are
# written in largely the same characters. That comparison carries a fault that cannot be removed with what
# is available: the Cantonese is subtitles and the Mandarin beside it is not from the same collection. A
# difference between them is ala difference of subject. It is reported and marked, and nothing leans on it.
#
# What the script pair alone can settle: if one language in two character sets reads as far apart as two
# unrelated languages do, the reading is following the writing.
