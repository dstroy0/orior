# Describe a text by what it gains at each distance, not by one number, for Section 4.13 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/4_measure/scale_profile.py
#
# Matching against a growing window shows every text still gaining at 262144 characters. No single
# window holds a text and the rate at any one of them is a reading of that choice. The sweep produces
# a curve instead of one number: how much a text knows at each distance, and how much each further
# distance adds.
#
# That curve is worth testing as a description of a language in its own right. The reading used until now
# is which character follows which, and one language read from two unrelated places sits 0.0867 apart
# while two languages read from one place sit 0.0936 apart. Where a text came from carries nearly as
# much as what language it is in. If what a language gains at each distance belongs to the language, that
# margin widens. If it belongs to the subject or the translator, it does not.
#
# The shuffle is subtracted at every window, since the estimator drifts with the window on its own and
# both arms carry that drift equally.
