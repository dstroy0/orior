# Several languages are now held from four places that have nothing to do with each other: novels and
# other books, encyclopedia articles, and two separate works translated into many languages. Nothing is
# shared between them: the subject, the century, the translator and the kind of writing all differ.
#
# That makes the question answerable directly instead of by argument. If the reading belongs to a
# language, the same language read from a novel and from an encyclopedia sits closer together than two
# different languages read from the same place. If it belongs to the source, the encyclopedia articles of
# every language sit together and the novels sit together, and the languages do not separate at all.
#
# Both distances are measured on the same texts and reported side by side. The answer is whichever is
# smaller, and it needs no threshold to read.
