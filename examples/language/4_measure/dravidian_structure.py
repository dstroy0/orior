# Score the reading against a family whose branchings are ordered, for Section 4.13 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/4_measure/dravidian_structure.py
#
# The earlier family result was scored against a tree argued from cognates, and where the reading and the
# tree disagreed nothing could say which was wrong. This asks a harder question of the same reading.
#
# Written down before the distances are computed, from the accepted account of the family: Tamil and
# Malayalam nearest each other, separated around the ninth century; Kannada beside that pair, inside South
# Dravidian but split earlier; Telugu furthest of the four, being South Central and older still. Three
# distances in a required order instead of a grouping. Beside them sit three Indo-Aryan languages of the same
# subcontinent, written in related scripts, which must all fall outside the Dravidian set: if they do not,
# the reading is following the writing systems of a region and not its languages.
#
# Every text is cut to one length. Tamil arrives with nearly seven times the characters of Malayalam, and
# a reading that moves with the amount of text would put those two at opposite ends for a reason that has
# nothing to do with either language.
