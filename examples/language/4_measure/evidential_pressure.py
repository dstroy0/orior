# Test whether languages that mark where a claim came from are found where the surroundings are hardest,
# for Section 4.13 of theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/data/fetch/wals_fetch.py        (once, to get the tables)
#           python examples/language/4_measure/evidential_pressure.py
#
# The claim is that where many things in the surroundings kill people, the pressure to teach is severe,
# and a language under that pressure grammaticalizes what reliable teaching needs: where a claim came
# from, and whether the outcome was anyone's to control. nɬeʔkepmxcín marks both. English marks neither
# and lets you say either optionally.
#
# Two things have to be handled or the answer is worthless.
#
# Languages are not independent of each other. Neighbors share features because they are neighbors and
# relatives share features because they are relatives. Counting languages counts history twice. This is
# Galton's problem and it is old. The fix used here is to draw one language per family, many times, and
# report what the draws do. A pattern that survives one language per family is not simply a large family
# being counted many times.
#
# And cold is the wrong measure of hard. The largest concentration of grammatical evidentiality on earth
# is Amazonia, which is equatorial, and lethal by disease, by what lives there and by having no sightlines.
# A test on distance from the equator would score the strongest case for this claim as the mildest place
# in the sample. So latitude is reported because it is what the data holds, and it is reported as a weak
# proxy that is expected to fail, and never as the test.
#
# What this cannot see: WALS records what a feature is. It does not record why. A correlation here would be consistent
# with the claim and would not establish it, since anything else that follows the same map, contact and
# descent above all, would produce the same number.
