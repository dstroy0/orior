# Give the reading more of the language to work with, for Section 4.13 of theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/4_measure/deeper_web.py
#
# One language read from two unrelated places sits 0.0867 apart and two languages read from the same place
# sit 0.0936 apart. Where a text came from carries nearly as much as what language it is in. That was
# recorded as a fact about languages and it is a fact about the reading.
#
# The reading holds which of the commonest 64 characters follows which, and that is 4096 numbers
# standing in for a whole language. Everything else is discarded: every dependency longer than one
# character, the entire tail of the alphabet past rank 64, where a character sits inside a word, and all
# word and morpheme structure. A margin of seven percent is what is left after that. It is not what
# a language is worth.
#
# So the reading is extended in the one direction that recovers dependencies instead of resolution. Pairs
# see one character back, triples see two, quadruples see three, and a language's habits live at those
# lengths: the letters that may follow each other, the endings it inflects with, the clusters it forbids.
# The alphabet is narrowed as the order grows so the count of numbers stays manageable, which trades
# breadth for depth deliberately, and it is stated here because it is a choice.
#
# The test is the same one that produced the seven percent, run again unchanged. If the margin widens, the
# reading was destroying the language. If it does not, the language really is only marginally there.
