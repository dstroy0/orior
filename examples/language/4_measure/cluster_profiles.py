# Group the languages by their positional ambiguity profile and check what the grouping recovers, for
# Section 4.13 of theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/4_measure/cluster_profiles.py
#
# The positional measurement produced eight curves and they were read by eye. Reading eight curves by eye
# is where this work has gone wrong before: a curve that looks like its neighbor is an impression, and the
# impression survives until something counts it.
#
# Hierarchical agglomerative clustering counts it. The two closest languages join, then the two closest
# groups, until one group is left, and the distance at every join is kept. The order of the joins is the
# tree and the distances are its heights.
#
# Two matrices are built because there are two questions. Clustering the profiles as measured asks which
# languages carry ambiguity at the same level, and the answer to that is mostly already known from the
# per-word counts. Dividing each profile by its own average takes the level out and leaves the shape,
# which asks whether the first three places form a signature that is independent of how ambiguous the
# language is overall.
#
# Average linkage is used because it is standard for this and because it does not push toward equal-sized
# groups the way Ward's method does.
#
# The cophenetic correlation is reported beside each tree. A tree can be built from any distance matrix
# whatsoever and will look like a result. The check compares the height at which each pair first landed
# in one group against the distance actually measured between them. A low value means the tree is
# imposing structure the distances do not carry, and the tree should then be read as an ordering and not
# as a grouping.
#
# Family and type are printed beside the trees, because a tree checked only against itself proves nothing.
#
# What this cannot see: eight languages is a small number to cluster and one merge changes the shape of
# everything above it. The heights are printed, and that makes a merge that barely beat its alternative visible.
