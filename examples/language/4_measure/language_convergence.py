# Test whether languages converge once their numbering is taken away, for Section 4.13 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/4_measure/language_convergence.py
#
# Four languages under the tightest numbering landed between 4.76 and 7.84 where they had spanned 15.61 to
# 31.44 as the files carried them, and Greek with 141 symbols sat on the same value as German with 73.
# Four is not enough to say anything and all four write in the same alphabet. A single writing system
# measured four times would look exactly like that.
#
# Everything here works on characters and not on bytes. A Chinese novel carries thousands of distinct
# characters, which no byte seating holds, and character width is also where its symbols are morphemes
# instead of pieces of one. A byte seating assumes eight bits throughout and cannot include it.
#
# Chinese is the case that decides this. If the tightest spread is set by how many symbols an alphabet
# has, it must sit far outside every alphabetic language. If it is set only by how the weight falls across
# whatever symbols there are, it can sit inside the same band. The prediction is not obvious either way
# and both outcomes are worth having. It is measured and not argued.
