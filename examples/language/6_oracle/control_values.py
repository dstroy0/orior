# Count what a nɬeʔkepmxcín narrative marks as done deliberately and what it marks as merely happening, for
# Section 4.13 of theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/language/6_oracle/control_values.py HallPhillipsICSNL60
#
# Everything measured in this work split a word's ambiguity two ways, into which kind of word it is and
# which form of it this is. Reading Lillooet showed a third thing marked on the verb that neither column
# holds, whether the actor had control of what happened. Hall and Phillips gloss nɬeʔkepmxcín with four
# values for it, control, limited control, change of state which they name as out of control, and
# autonomous, and they gloss an inferential evidential beside it. So the axis that had no column is
# written on every verb of a story, and it can be counted instead of argued about.
#
# The story is a creation account, and that makes the count worth taking. Old One makes the earth, and an
# English reading of it says he made the world deliberately. The glosses do not obviously agree: he scratches
# and piles and throws under control, and the flatland, the pitch and the rock arrive under change of
# state. If that holds across the whole text then the world here is a by-product of a being existing and
# moving, and the grammar says so on every verb, which is not a reading anyone imposed on it.
#
# The abbreviation key lists every one of these tags once, in a footnote, and counting it would put a tally
# of one against each value and call that a distribution. The key is found and skipped here.
#
# What this cannot see: one story by one speaker. It says what this text does. It does not say what
# nɬeʔkepmxcín does, and a second text could come out the other way.
