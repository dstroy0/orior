# Fixed-pattern video noise removed to the bit, by the same instrument the sound denoiser uses.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/art/4_measure/fixed_pattern_removed_to_the_bit.py
#
# Fixed-pattern noise is the coherent noise of a camera: a per-pixel offset the sensor adds to every
# frame, the same offset in the same place each time. Read a frame stack frame after frame and that
# offset repeats with a period of exactly one frame. It is the coherent-addend case the sound
# denoiser handles, on a signal that happens to be pictures. Nothing here is ported from that file and
# nothing needs to be: reference.periodic and measure.periodic_energy read points carrying values and
# cannot tell a frame stack from a waveform. This is the README's one instrument, shown reading the
# second medium.
#
# The period is the frame size, the file's geometry and a declared input instead of a fitted one.
# It is confirmed here anyway: measure.periodic_energy recovers it from the stack against a shuffle,
# the same way ART-4-001 recovers a still image's width. Once it is confirmed the fixed pattern is the
# per-pixel mean across frames, which reference.periodic builds, and the residual is the moving scene.
# Where the scene sums to zero at each pixel across the frames -- where the content moves and does not
# sit still anywhere -- the per-pixel mean IS the fixed pattern exactly, and the residual is the scene
# to the last bit.
#
# WHAT MAKES THE READING EVIDENCE, AND THE FLOOR
#
# Two routes build the per-pixel mean, batch and incremental, and a deliberately broken third is run
# beside them so their agreeing is shown to be a property the wrong one lacks. The null is drawn: the
# stack is shuffled, the frame period is gone, and removing at a wrong period takes nothing real.
#
# The floor is the honest limit of fixed-pattern correction and it is worth stating plainly, because
# it is why cameras need a dark frame or motion. A scene feature that never moves -- a pixel that is
# bright in every frame in the same place -- is indistinguishable from a fixed pattern, because both
# are a constant per-pixel offset across the stack. This removes it along with the noise, and the
# reduction falls by exactly the static feature's energy. That is not a defect. Noise shaped exactly
# like the signal is the single thing no instrument can reject, and a static object is signal shaped
# exactly like fixed-pattern noise.
#
# A native-C route is the natural hardening and is not claimed here.
