# Put the two instruments in this work on the same picture and see whether they agree, for Section 4.11 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/art/4_measure/picture_width_agreement.py
#
# Three claims in this work reported one instrument's result as the other's, because both return a number
# near one for nothing and a departure for something. Nothing was ever measured to connect them. This
# measures it.
#
# A picture stored row by row carries its width as a period. Both instruments should be able to find
# it. The shift detector reads the share of positions equal to the position one lag away and takes the
# lag where that share peaks. Section 4.11 recovered a record period that way. The point cloud
# reduction reads the displacement from each point to the nearest point holding the same value, and at
# the true width the picture reshapes into a plane where those displacements are short and directional,
# while at a wrong width the rows slide against each other and the arrangement is scrambled.
#
# The two share neither code, null nor statistic. If they peak at the same width on the same file, that
# is a measured link between them and the first this work has. If they peak at different widths, at most
# one of them recovers a picture's width and the other has been reporting something else.
#
# Both are swept over the widths that divide the file length exactly, since a partial final row is not a
# rectangle. The true width is not supplied to either.
