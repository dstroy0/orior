# Classify the noise on a stack of same-source images, reject it, and hand back the clean subject with
# the uncertainty stated exactly: zero where two exact routes agree, and flagged where they do not.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/art/4_measure/classify_reject_recover.py            the built-in controls
#           python examples/art/4_measure/classify_reject_recover.py --mode fixed-pattern --in DIR --out DIR
#           python examples/art/4_measure/classify_reject_recover.py --mode repeat --in DIR --out DIR
#
# This is the proofing filter. It reads a stack of same-source images laid one after another as a flat
# sequence whose period is the frame size, and a pixel and the same pixel one frame later fall in one
# phase class. The engine already reads that shape: measure.periodic_energy detects and
# reference.periodic rejects, the same files ART-4-005 and ART-4-006 use. A stack goes in; a verdict, a
# clean subject and an exact uncertainty come back. Every number is exact rational; the only floats are
# the printed ones.
#
# WHAT THE DATA CANNOT TELL YOU, AND YOU MUST DECLARE. A coherent per-pixel component across a stack is
# either the SUBJECT, when the subject is the same in every frame, or the NOISE, when the subject varies
# and a pattern is fixed. BOTH produce the same strong per-pixel mean, and no measurement on the stack
# separates them, because the split is which one you call signal. That is the caller's declaration, not
# the detector's finding. This filter takes a mode:
#   --mode fixed-pattern : the subject VARIES frame to frame; the shared per-pixel component is NOISE.
#                          Reject it by subtracting the per-pixel mean; each frame's residual is its own
#                          subject. Exact to the bit where the subject sums to zero at each pixel across
#                          the stack; the shortfall on real content is the floor, a static feature shaped
#                          exactly like the pattern.
#   --mode repeat        : the subject is the SAME in every frame; the shared component is the SUBJECT to
#                          KEEP. The noise is the per-frame deviation. Reject it by per-pixel consensus,
#                          exact where a strict majority survives; a class with no majority is the floor.
# Running fixed-pattern removal on a repeat erases the subject, and running consensus on a varying
# subject returns nothing any frame held. The mode is the guard against both, and there is no default
# that guesses it.
#
# THE UNCERTAINTY. Two independent exact routes are run for the reject. Where they land on the same
# integer the uncertainty at that pixel is exactly zero, because two different exact computations agree
# and nothing rounded. Where they differ the pixel is flagged and counted, and it is reported, never
# returned as if it were clean. NOTHING IS BOUNDED HERE: the fixed-pattern decision is the drawn null,
# and the repeat floor is the classes with no majority, neither a threshold chosen here.
