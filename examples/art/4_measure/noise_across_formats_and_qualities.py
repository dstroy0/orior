# Fixed-pattern removal, held to the bit across image formats and across qualities of noise.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/art/4_measure/noise_across_formats_and_qualities.py
#
# ART-4-005 removed one fixed pattern from one 8x8 stack and reached 100% on a synthetic control. This
# widens that reading along the two axes a reader asks about next: does the format the pixels are
# stored in change the answer, and does the KIND of noise change it. Nothing here is a new instrument.
# The detector is measure.periodic_energy and the reject is reference.periodic, the same two files
# ART-4-005 used; this script only feeds them pixels from more places and noise of more kinds and
# reports what comes back. Every number is exact rational; the only floats are the %.3f in the prints.
#
# THE FORMAT AXIS. The detector reads points carrying values and cannot see a file format. The only way
# a format can matter is whether it preserves the values. A lossless format (PNG at any depth, a
# baseline TIFF, the CTC 16-bit TIFF) round-trips the stack bit for bit. The reading is identical to
# the one taken before it was written. A lossy format (JPEG) is itself a noise source: its block
# quantization depends on the local content. The same fixed pattern added to different frames decodes
# to a DIFFERENT pattern per frame, the per-pixel mean is no longer the pattern, and the removal can no
# longer reach the bit. The lossy row is not a failure of the instrument; it is the format injecting
# incoherent noise the instrument then correctly cannot scrub to zero.
#
# THE NOISE AXIS. The removal is exact for exactly one kind of noise: a coherent additive offset that
# repeats at the frame period, over a target that sums to zero at each pixel across the frames. This
# script shows the boundary of that case from both sides. Raising the pattern's amplitude does not
# change the 100% -- the arithmetic is exact at any amplitude -- but it does move the detector's margin
# above the drawn null, and a weak pattern fails to be SEEN, and is still removed. Incoherent noise of
# every kind -- independent per-frame Gaussian, impulses, Poisson shot --
# is declined: it carries no phase at the frame period, sits inside the null band, and is left intact.
# A mix of a fixed pattern and Gaussian is the realistic case and reports the coherent fraction, which
# is a measured number between the two, not 100%.
#
# THE CTC AXIS. Real 16-bit fluorescence frames from the Cell Tracking Challenge, read straight from the
# local zip in repos/external/datasets, cropped to a small tile so the exact-rational scan stays cheap.
# Two readings. The real tile as it is: the detector is asked whether a coherent fixed pattern is
# present, and on this footage it declines -- a real-world negative control, the 100% is not handed out
# for free. The real tile with a known fixed pattern added: the detector fires and removes it, but real
# content does NOT sum to zero per pixel. The per-pixel mean carries the scene's static background
# with the pattern and the residual is not the scene. The NRR is below 100% and the shortfall is the
# floor ART-4-005 named, shown here on real data instead of a constructed static feature.
#
# NOTHING IS BOUNDED HERE. Every declared input is a constant below, printed with the reading. Every
# decision to remove or decline is made against a null band drawn from the data by shuffling, never a
# threshold chosen here. The two mean routes, batch and incremental, are checked bit-exact against each
# other in every additive arm, and a deliberately broken third is run beside them so their agreement is
# shown to be a property the wrong route lacks. A native-C route is the natural hardening and is not
# claimed here.
