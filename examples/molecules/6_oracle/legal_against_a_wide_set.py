# A molecular formula tested for a legal valence structure, by exact integers, against a wide set.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/molecules/6_oracle/legal_against_a_wide_set.py
#
# A formula has a legal valence structure only where three integer conditions hold on the valences its
# atoms carry. Write v for an atom's valence, the bonds it must make, and read them off the same shells
# the assembly stage did. Then, over a formula's atoms:
#
#   the sum of the valences is even, because every bond spends two valences, one at each end;
#   no atom carries more valence than all the others together, or it has nothing to bond the surplus to;
#   the sum is at least twice the atom count less one, or there are too few bonds to join the atoms.
#
# The three are necessary for a structure to exist, and they are checked by integer equality and
# comparison, with no tolerance. They are not sufficient: a formula that passes may still be a strained
# or unstable isomer, and a multivalent atom read at one valence may error where a higher valence
# would pass. So this is a sift, a necessary condition, and it is measured as one: run over a wide set
# of real molecules it should pass nearly all of them, the positive control, and it should error on the
# crafted illegal formulae, the negative control.
#
# The wide set is the molecular formulae of the first several thousand PubChem compounds, fetched by
# utils/maint/data/fetch/fetch_pubchem_formulae.py. A charged formula is an ion, whose valence count carries
# an extra electron this neutral reading does not model, and those are set aside and counted. A formula
# with an element the valence table does not carry is set aside too, named instead of guessed.
#
# Integer arithmetic only, with no library and no rounding. Source of the valences: the standard
# main-group valences, the same shell deficits the assembly stage reads. Source of the wide set: the
# PubChem compound database.
