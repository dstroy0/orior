# Building the molecules the valence rules allow, over a composition space, ten thousand and more.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/molecules/1_represent/build_legal_molecules.py
#
# The assembly stage reads the bond count off an atom's shell. This walks the other way: it enumerates
# the compositions of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen within a bound, turns each into the degree
# list its atoms carry, and keeps the ones a molecule graph can hold. Each atom's degree is its capacity
# from assembly_from_atomic_properties, read from element.electrons, and the build takes its valences
# from the ledger and puts none in by hand. The keep decision is connected_multigraph in measure, the
# same gate the wide-set detector runs, and what is built legal and what is detected legal are one test.
#
# The gate is a necessary condition and is not sufficient: a built formula is one that could be a molecule,
# which is short of one that is. The space the rules allow is far larger than the molecules that exist, and the point
# of building it is that count and that containment: the real molecules the detector passed all sit
# inside this legal space, because they clear the same gate. Integer arithmetic only, no bound.
