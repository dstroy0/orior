# The bond count an atom carries, read off its outermost shell, and the assembly that count dictates.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/molecules/1_represent/assembly_from_atomic_properties.py
#
# An atom assembles by the one magnitude its outermost shell carries: the deficit to a closed shell. A
# shell closes at two electrons for the first, at eight for the main-group shells past it, the duet and
# the octet, and those closures are the shell closures the periodic-law measure stage read off the
# accumulation. An atom with v electrons in its outermost shell is v short one way and closed-minus-v
# short the other, and it forms the smaller of the two in bonds: min(v, closed - v). That integer is the
# capacity, the vector magnitude the atom brings to assembly, and it dictates the stoichiometry with no
# tolerance and no measured length.
#
# The rules are not put in here. The capacity is read from element.electrons, the same ledger the atom
# stage represents, and the closures are read from the same shells. What comes out is the simplest
# hydride of each element and the bond order of its homonuclear pair: oxygen at capacity two binds two
# hydrogens and doubles with itself, nitrogen at three binds three and triples, carbon at four binds
# four. Water, ammonia and methane are the capacity counting hydrogens, not a fact told to the reader.
#
# The main group is where one magnitude suffices. The d-block and f-block carry a partly filled inner
# shell and a variable valence. This reads the first eighteen elements and says where it stops.
# Bonding has more to it than a count, bond length and angle and energy among it, and those are the
# chemistry subject's oracle. This reads the count.
