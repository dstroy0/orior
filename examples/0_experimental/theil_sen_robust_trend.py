# Reject a trend the outliers cannot drag: the slope the majority of pairs agree on (Theil-Sen).
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/theil_sen_robust_trend.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an algorithm shown working, a robust-regression
# filter beside the signal ones. The invariant here is a linear trend, and the consensus is the slope
# the majority of point PAIRS agree on: the Theil-Sen estimator takes the median of every pairwise
# slope, and the intercept as the median of the residual offsets. It is application logic and not an
# engine primitive, for the same reason the collaborative filter is -- a trend estimate is what a
# reading is measured INTO instead of the null it stands against.
#
# Why it is in the family. Two points from a clean line give exactly the line's slope; a point pulled
# off the line by an outlier gives a slope that is nearly anything. So the clean pairs all agree on one
# slope and the corrupted pairs scatter, and the median lands on the value the clean majority carries,
# exactly as the phase consensus lands on the value the clean members of a class carry. It rejects the
# trend robustly: subtract the Theil-Sen line and the residual is the signal with its trend gone, and a
# handful of outliers did not move the trend.
#
# TWO ROUTES THAT GENUINELY DISAGREE, AND THE DISAGREEMENT IS THE FINDING. Least-squares fits the same
# line by minimizing squared error, and a single outlier drags it because a square rewards the fit for
# chasing the far point. Theil-Sen and least-squares therefore return DIFFERENT slopes on the same data
# whenever an outlier is present, and that gap is not a bug to reconcile: it is the measurement of what
# a square costs. Where the data is clean the two agree; where it is not, the robust route
# kept the slope and the square is the wrong reference.
#
# NOTHING IS BOUNDED HERE. The slope is a median, a rank, not a residual threshold chosen by anyone. The
# arithmetic is exact rational. A clean line is recovered to the last digit. The floor is stated and
# swept: Theil-Sen's slope breaks near a bit under a third of the points being outliers, the published
# breakdown point, and the sweep shows it move.
