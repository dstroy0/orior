# The Navier-Stokes equations on the unit torus, run in the engine's exact integer arithmetic over the
# sets Fefferman's problem statement names: an exact solution reproduced by two routes, the horizon a
# generic datum runs past, the two removals (viscosity, force) shown on an instance to change the
# solution, and the countable island of exactly nameable fields inside the uncountable data class. It
# claims nothing about any open problem. It presents the rigor and stops.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_navier_stokes_on_torus.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. The sets are Fefferman's, read from the Clay statement: equations (1) momentum, (2)
# divergence, (3) initial datum; (8) periodic datum and force with the erratum's periodic pressure; (10)
# periodic solution; (11) smooth pressure and velocity; and (7) bounded energy, which on the torus is
# Parseval's sum over the unit cell. The period is 1, the unit vectors e_j, as the statement writes it.
#
# The arithmetic is the engine's alone: Python integers as the bignum, the decimal inputs read by
# representation.exact as (numerator, places) pairs, and booleans. No float, no Decimal, no fraction
# library. A field on R^3/Z^3 is a finite sum of modes e^{2 pi i k.x}, k in Z^3, each mode carrying a
# Laurent polynomial in pi with Gaussian INTEGER coefficients, and the whole field carrying one positive
# integer denominator, the way exact.py carries one count of decimal places. The denominator is widened
# past a power of ten for one reason: the projection onto divergence-free fields divides by |k|^2, and
# 1/3 has no exact decimal at any scale, and a decimal scale would then have to error
# (exact.WillNotFit) where an integer denominator carries the value exactly. Every field is normalized
# by the greatest common divisor of its denominator and every integer in it. Two fields are equal
# exactly when their integers are equal, and pi is a symbol: pi is transcendental (Lindemann 1882), and
# a Laurent polynomial in pi with integer coefficients is therefore zero exactly when every coefficient
# is zero.
#
# A derivative multiplies a mode by 2 pi i k_j, a product convolves modes (a linear convolution on Z^3,
# unaliased), the Laplacian multiplies by -4 pi^2 |k|^2, and the Leray projection removes the gradient
# part mode by mode. Every element is smooth and periodic. (8), (10) and (11) hold by construction,
# (2) is an exact identity, the pressure is in the same ring and so is periodic, and the energy is an
# exact Laurent polynomial in pi over an integer. The solution is carried as Taylor coefficients in t
# at t = 0, u(t) = sum_m u_m t^m / m!, by the recurrence
#
#   u_{m+1} = nu Laplacian u_m - P sum_{j=0}^{m} C(m,j) (u_j . grad) u_{m-j},   p_m from the same sum,
#
# which is (1) differentiated m times at t = 0 with (2) enforced by P. Nothing is rounded anywhere.
#
# Positive control: the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress field u_0 = (A sin 2 pi z + C cos 2 pi y,
# B sin 2 pi x + A cos 2 pi z, C sin 2 pi y + B cos 2 pi x) is Beltrami, curl u_0 = 2 pi u_0. The
# nonlinear term is a pure gradient and u = e^{-4 nu pi^2 t} u_0, p = -e^{-8 nu pi^2 t} |u_0|^2 / 2 solves
# (1), (2), (3) exactly. The recurrence must return u_m = (-4 nu pi^2)^m u_0 and p_m = (-8 nu pi^2)^m p_0
# to the integer, and it does.
#
# Two routes: the velocity recurrence above, with the pressure, and the vorticity recurrence
# omega_{m+1} = nu Laplacian omega_m - sum_j C(m,j) [ (u_j . grad) omega_{m-j} - (omega_j . grad) u_{m-j} ]
# with u_j recovered from omega_j by Biot-Savart, no pressure anywhere. They meet at curl u_m = omega_m at
# every order, on the exact solution and on a generic datum. Drawn null: dropping the vortex-stretching
# term (omega . grad) u, the two-dimensional form of the equation, breaks the agreement in three
# dimensions; a wrong pressure sign leaves a nonzero residual on the exact solution.
#
# Floor: none in the arithmetic. The boundary is the horizon: the Taylor coefficients of a generic datum
# occupy more modes at every order; a truncation at any fixed mode radius therefore misses some order,
# and the count it misses is measured here instead of bounded. No bounding: every value is an exact integer
# and every test an exact equality.
#
# Whose forms these are, named with respect. Every object here belongs to the field, and this file only
# runs them exactly: the problem statement, its numbered conditions and the four alternatives are Charles
# Fefferman's, for the Clay Mathematics Institute, read in full including the errata; the equations are
# Navier's and Stokes's, and the inviscid case Euler's; the field with curl u proportional to u is
# Beltrami's, and the three-term example is Arnold's (1965) and Childress's (1970), reported from memory
# of the literature, unread here. The file verifies the solution itself and does not rest on the
# citation; the projection onto divergence-free fields and the pressure it defines are Leray's; the
# recovery of a velocity from its vorticity is the Biot-Savart law, and the vorticity equation is
# Helmholtz's; the energy sum over modes is Parseval's; the transcendence of pi that makes the zero test
# exact is Lindemann's (1882); the recurrence for the Taylor coefficients is the classical power-series
# method of Cauchy and Kovalevskaya. The Beale-Kato-Majda criterion that Fefferman's statement quotes is
# named in the workbook beside this file and is not used here. Nothing in this file is new mathematics.
