// The automata of Turing's method over one cell of the Riemann-Siegel formula, as programs of the record machine on
// the device, one job on the device's tessera daemon. The machine one level up, exact_zeta_turing.py, runs a cell
// at a time and joins the cells.
//
//   Usage:  exact_zeta_turing <input> <output>
//
// Point j of cell nu stands at t = 2 pi s, s = x^2 = S / 2^p, S = nu^2 2^p + j (2 nu + 1), for j below P = 2^p: the
// lattice is even in t, and in theta to within 1 / nu across the cell. Every value is an integer at the scale 2^62,
// and a step that takes a product back to that scale divides by 2^31 twice, toward zero, an error below one unit;
// the bound on every value's error is the machine's to hold, from the program's own steps.
//
// The logarithm folds: ln(V / 2^b) = f ln 2 + 2 artanh((V - 2^(b + f)) / (V + 2^(b + f))), where 2^f is the product
// over i of 1 + [V > 2^(b + i)]; the artanh's argument lies in [0, 1/3]. w^(-1/2) is Newton's rule
// y (3 - w y^2) / 2 from 2^(-g - 1), where 2^g is the product over i of 1 + [w > 4^i]; it starts within a factor 2
// of the root and below it. Each lane works out its own.
//
// The pole stage, one lane a k <= nu: ln k and k^(-1/2), and for the multiple evaluation each pole's place, weight
// and charge.
//
// The point stage, one lane a point: theta / pi = s ln s - s - 1/8 + 1 / (96 pi^2 s); x = s s^(-1/2); C_0(z),
// z = 1 - 2 (x - nu), by Horner's rule over its Taylor coefficients; x^(-1/2); and (-1)^(nu - 1) x^(-1/2) C_0.
//
// The pair stage, one lane a pair (j, k), lane (j - start) nu + k - 1, reads its pole's record and its point's record
// through the index: the phase over pi, theta / pi - 2 s ln k, taken modulo 2 into [-1, 1) by a wrap, which leaves
// cos(pi Q) as it is; cos(pi s) by Horner's rule in s^2 over (-1)^k pi^(2k) / (2k)!; and the term k^(-1/2) cos(pi s).
// It runs in pieces of points from `start` up, and the sum over each point's nu lanes is the main sum's half.
//
// The verdict stage, one lane a point, reads the sums, the point records and the shared record as its three members:
// Z = 2 sum + (-1)^(nu - 1) x^(-1/2) C_0, its sign where |Z| exceeds the bound, else 0, theta / pi less and more its
// bound, and each times the step of S, 2 nu + 1, the same at every point and from the cell's last point to the next
// cell's point 0; and w = exp(i theta) F, its real part the main sum's half, its imaginary part the multiple
// evaluation's and 0 by pairs.
//
// The count stage, one lane a point q, reads the verdict records at q, q - 1 and q - 2 as its three members: a zero
// ends at q where q's sign is certified and the last certified sign before it, one or two points back, is the other;
// it gives that, S at q and at the zero's other end, and a mark where q follows two uncertified points.
//
// Over the first certified point F of the cell, the device sums: the less-steps over [0, F) and [F, P), the
// more-steps over [1, F] and (F, P), the zeros and their S at each end over [0, F] and (F, P), and the marks over
// (F, P).
//
// The main sum's half comes from the pair stage, or from the multiple evaluation below, or from both, the method
// word 0, 1 or 2, or from the pair stage at listed points, 4; with both, the verdict is the multiple evaluation's and the most the two Z differ by is written.
//
// Method 3 is Euler-Maclaurin, which holds at every t: zeta = sum over n < N of n^(-s) + N^(-s) C, the pole stage
// takes k <= N, the pair stage the N - 1 terms of each point, and the Euler-Maclaurin stage C and the term
// Re(exp(i theta) N^(-s) C); the verdict takes Z = sum + that term, with no doubling, and its bound is the machine's.
// Method 4 is the listed points: the pairs at the points j of the lattice of 2^p the input lists, as many as its
// points word, in place of every point of the cell. The point stage reads j from the list and gives S last, the pair
// and verdict stages read S from it, and the count runs over the points in the order listed. It certifies the signs
// at those points alone, for the steps of a coarser run that can hide a pair.
//
// The multiple evaluation runs each of its programs many times a cell: the host checks a stage's first run over
// `checked` lanes and each later run over its first lane.
//
// The input, little-endian: 64-bit words points (2^p), checked, nu, p, L, K, J, Newton steps, piece, method, the
// expansions' order, beta, E, R, for method 3 Euler-Maclaurin's N and M, else 0 and 0, and 1 where every point is
// to be listed, 2 where every point is to be listed with the twist, which the multiple evaluation alone gives, else
// 0, then the constants, each a 64-bit word count w, w 32-bit limbs of its magnitude least significant first, and a
// 64-bit sign word: ln 2, the J
// coefficients of C_0, the L constants 1 / (2k + 1) of artanh, the K constants of cos, 1 / (96 pi^2), the bound on Z,
// the bound on theta / pi, pi, the E constants 1 / (n + 1)! of E1, the R constants of S, and for method 3 the M - 1
// ratios r_k for k from 2 to M, every one at 2^62, and for method 4 the listed points j, one 64-bit word each.
//
// The output: lines "key value" and "key value value ...", values signed hexadecimal: the cell, its first and last
// certified points and point 0, each with its sign, S, and theta / pi less and more its bound, the sums, Z at two
// points for the positive control, the host's checks of every stage and sum, each 1 where they equal the device's
// word for word, the steps of each program, with both methods the most the two Z differ by and the point it falls
// at, and where the input asks, each point's sign, S, Z and w, and with the twist the shift and each point's
// exp(i theta) F' / 2^shift.
//
// The twist: the pole stage again with a and every charge times -i ln k / 2^shift, 2^shift at least ln nu, and the
// multiple evaluation over those poles gives F' / 2^shift at every point, F' = dF/dt. The twist stage turns it by
// exp(i theta) beside w; (exp(i theta) F') / w = F'/F, the twist (arg F)' its imaginary part and the swell (ln |F|)' its
// real part. It places no point and certifies no sign.
