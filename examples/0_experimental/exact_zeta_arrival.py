# What each wave lands in where it joins the main sum, read at the boundaries t = 2pi n^2 by the device.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_arrival.py [n0 ...]
#           python examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_arrival.py stretch <n0> <windows>
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental and is an entry in the analytic number theory workbook, on its
# rail: it claims nothing about the Riemann hypothesis.
#
# THE BOUNDARY
#
# The main sum of Riemann-Siegel is a sum of waves m^(-1/2) e^(i(theta - t ln m)). In the frame e^(i theta) turns, wave
# m spins at ln(x / m), x = sqrt(t / 2pi): it stands still at x = m and joins the sum there, at t = 2pi n^2 for n = m.
# There its phase is theta - t ln n = -pi n^2 - pi / 8 to theta's first terms, -pi / 8 for even n and pi - pi / 8 for
# odd. The waves already there, m < n, stand at 2pi n^2 ln m modulo a turn. The reading at a boundary is the angle
# between the arriving wave and their sum: V_n = sum over m < n of m^(-1/2) e^(-2pi i n^2 ln m) turned by the arriving
# wave's own phase, P_n = V_n e^(2pi i n^2 ln n). theta turns both alike and drops out.
#
# THE RELATION
#
# Along n, wave m's phase n^2 ln m has the constant second difference 2 ln m: a lane steps from one boundary to the
# next by u <- u r and r <- r q, with u = e^(-2pi i n^2 ln m), r = e^(-2pi i (2n + 1) ln m) and q = e^(-4pi i ln m).
# exact_zeta_arrival.cu runs that on the device, one lane a wave, and sums every boundary across its lanes with
# cycle_record_sum. At a fixed n0, u, r, q and m^(-1/2) are completely multiplicative in m: each is computed at the
# primes, from ln p and the phase n0^2 ln p reduced modulo a turn as an exact integer, and each composite m is the
# product over its least prime factor. Only the primes ask for a cosine and a sine.
#
# THE MEAN
#
# Each boundary's reading is the unit pair P_n / |P_n| at the scale S = 2^62. The tally is their exact sum and the run
# their count, and the mean at every boundary is tally / run, an exact rational: nothing is merged, rounded or dropped,
# and every boundary's mean is kept. The spread is read as |tally|^2 / (run S^2), an exact rational: run where every
# reading points one way, and near 1 where they spread like independent angles.
#
# With stretch, windows run end to end from n0, each seeded at its own first boundary, and every reading goes into one
# tally over the whole stretch beside each window's own; the stretch's first and last boundaries are summed directly.
#
# Positive control: a window from n0 = 0 against V_n summed directly on the host, every wave's phase from its own
# logarithm, the gap in units of 2^-62, and every window's first and last boundary the same way. The bar is drawn: the
# device's V_n meets the direct sum within 2^-40 at every boundary checked.
