# A translation between two views recovered exactly by an integer number theoretic transform, its
# correlation agreeing to the digit with the direct O(N^2) count, and the single-prime floor drawn.
#
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_translation_by_ntt.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: a transform shown working on two synthetic views
# instead of a stage reading. It is the translation transform proposed in the image_transforms exact-arithmetic
# chapter, built here atop the same exact-integer discipline as src/engine/c/no_rounding/ but not part
# of that kernel. The kernel counts exact-value agreements at a lag; this counts overlap of two views
# at every lag by convolution, which is a different operation and a new module.
#
# The shift between two views is the lag maximizing C(l) = sum_v a(v) b(v+l), the agreement of one view
# with the other slid by l. That correlation is a convolution, and a number theoretic transform
# computes a convolution exactly in the integers modulo a prime p, with no float and no rounding, when
# p carries a root of unity of the transform length. The prime is p = 998244353 = 119 * 2^23 + 1,
# primitive root 3, certified in ntt_twiddle_certificate.py and in theory/theory/cryptography/twiddle_constants/main.tex.
#
# Four things are shown. Positive control: the NTT correlation equals the direct O(N^2) correlation at
# EVERY lag, exactly, on binary views, and its peak is the true shift. Two routes able to disagree:
# with weighted views and a deliberately too-small prime the NTT route wraps and parts from the direct
# route. Their agreement above is an earned result. Drawn null: the true-shift peak is set
# against the best spurious peak between two INDEPENDENT views. The separation is measured. It is not
# asserted. Stated floor: a single prime is exact only while every coefficient stays below it; for 0/1
# views the transform length caps the coefficient below p automatically, and weighting is what can
# breach it, whereupon the remedy is a larger prime or CRT over several, the device path in that paper.
#
# No bounding: view length, set-point count and the true shift are declared inputs, printed with the
# run. No threshold decides the shift; it is the argmax of an exact integer correlation.
