# Mathematical morphology: opening removes bright speckle, closing fills dark speckle, by rank alone.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/morphology_opening_and_closing.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an algorithm shown working, an image-morphology
# filter beside the signal ones. Erosion takes the minimum over a structuring element, dilation the
# maximum; opening is an erosion then a dilation, closing a dilation then an erosion. Opening removes a
# bright feature narrower than the element and leaves everything wider untouched; closing does the same
# for a dark feature. It is a rank operator. Like the windowed median it rejects a replacement noise
# a mean cannot, and it needs no threshold: the element width is a declared input and min and max are
# positions in a sorted window instead of tolerances.
#
# It is application logic and not an engine primitive, and for the reason the collaborative filter
# is: opening TRANSFORMS the reading into a different reading of itself. It is not a null a departure is
# measured against. It is not a reference-stage object; it is an operator, and operators live in the
# example until the ladder has a place for them.
#
# Two routes take the min and the max with no shared code: one sorts the window and reads an end, the
# other walks the window tracking a running extreme. The floor is stated: a real feature narrower than
# the element is removed with the speckle, because rank alone cannot tell a one-pixel spike that is
# signal from one that is noise.
