# The Riemann zeta function at the even integers, computed exactly: zeta(2k) = c_k * pi^(2k) with c_k
# an exact rational from the Bernoulli numbers, cross-checked by Euler's convolution identity, which is
# exact and free of pi.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_values.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. It is the first entry of an analytic-number-theory workbook, and it claims nothing about any
# open problem. The Riemann hypothesis concerns the ZEROS of zeta(s) in the critical strip; this file
# touches none of them. It computes the VALUES at the even integers, which have a closed form Euler
# found, and it uses the engine's exact arithmetic to carry them with no rounding and to check them by a
# second route that does not go through pi at all.
#
# Two routes. The values come from zeta(2k) = |B_{2k}| (2 pi)^{2k} / (2 (2k)!), the Bernoulli numbers
# computed as exact rationals. The check is Euler's identity, sum_{j=1}^{k-1} zeta(2j) zeta(2k-2j) =
# (k + 1/2) zeta(2k): every term carries pi^{2k}. The factor cancels and the identity becomes an
# exact rational statement about the c_k, derived a different way than the Bernoulli formula. The two
# agreeing is the positive control. Drawn null: a wrong coefficient, zeta(4) = pi^4/80 in place of /90,
# fails the identity. No bounding: the coefficients are exact rationals and the high-precision values
# are exact scaled integers built on pi computed two ways.
