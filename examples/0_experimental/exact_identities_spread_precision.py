# Exact identities carry precision from a few computed constants to unboundedly many derived ones, and
# the multiplier is counted.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_identities_spread_precision.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. It is the mechanism behind a goal to raise the accuracy the engine holds by a large factor.
# A constant computed once to N places by its own series is expensive. An exact identity that ties it
# to another constant hands that other constant the same N places for the cost of one multiply. A small
# seed of directly computed constants then generates a large set of derived ones at the same precision,
# and the ratio of derived to seed is the accuracy multiplier.
#
# The example works the natural constants, where this holds without bound. Three families:
#   roots  sqrt(n) for every n whose prime factors are among the seed primes, from sqrt(p) by
#          sqrt(n) = product of sqrt(p)^e. Seed: the prime square roots.
#   zetas  zeta(2k) = rational * pi^(2k), from one seed, pi. Seed: pi.
#   logs   ln(q) for every rational q built from the seed primes, by ln(q) = sum of e * ln(p).
# Each derived value is checked by a SECOND, independent route: the derived sqrt against a direct
# integer square root, the zeta ratios against each other, the derived log against a direct series. A
# derived value that fails its second route is not carried. Two routes or it does not ship.
#
# The null is drawn: a FALSE identity (sqrt(6) = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3), or phi^2 = phi + 2) is run through
# the same second-route check and errored. Agreement under a true identity is a tested result.
#
# The floor is stated and measured: each scaled operation floors and loses less than one unit in the
# last working place, and a derivation chain of depth d loses under d units, which a guard of a few
# places absorbs. That floor is arithmetic. There is a second floor this example does NOT cross and
# says so: a MEASURED quantity (a crystal edge, a physical constant) carries an upstream measurement
# floor that no identity on this end raises past. The spread multiplies precision only where the
# quantity is defined by exact operations and is never measured.
