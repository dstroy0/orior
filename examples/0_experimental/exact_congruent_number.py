# The congruent number problem, the oldest question that sits on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
# conjecture, read in exact integer and rational arithmetic. It runs the two things BSD makes exactly
# computable: Tunnell's criterion, a pure integer count of a ternary quadratic form, and the rational
# points on the curve C_n : y^2 = x^3 - n^2 x, whose group law is exact rational arithmetic. It claims
# nothing about the conjecture. It shows which side of it is exact and which side is a computed real.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_congruent_number.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. The arithmetic is the engine's own: Python integers as the bignum, and an exact rational
# carried as a reduced (numerator, denominator) pair of native integers, reduced by a hand-written
# Euclid. No float, no fraction library, no math library; the one square root needed is an integer
# Newton iteration on native integers.
#
# WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. A congruent number is a squarefree positive integer that is the area of a right
# triangle with rational sides. Fibonacci was challenged with n = 5 and found the triangle (3/2, 20/3,
# 41/6). Fermat proved n = 1 is not congruent. The problem, in the words of Wiles's Clay statement,
# reduces to the rational points on C_n : y^2 = x^3 - n^2 x: n is congruent exactly when C_n(Q) is
# infinite, which BSD ties to L(C_n, 1) = 0.
#
# THE TWO EXACT HANDLES.
#   Tunnell's count   For n odd and squarefree, Tunnell proved unconditionally that if n is congruent
#                     then A(n) = 2 B(n), where A(n) = #{(x,y,z) in Z^3 : 2x^2 + y^2 + 8z^2 = n} and
#                     B(n) = #{(x,y,z) : 2x^2 + y^2 + 32z^2 = n}. These are exact integer counts. The
#                     contrapositive is unconditional: A(n) != 2 B(n) proves n is not congruent, and it
#                     reproduces Fermat's n = 1. The converse, that the equality implies congruent, is
#                     conditional on BSD, and that is the floor, stated and not crossed.
#   the group law     C_n(Q) is a finitely generated abelian group under the chord-tangent law, which is
#                     exact rational arithmetic. A rational point whose coordinates are not integers is
#                     not torsion, by Nagell-Lutz; it then has infinite order, C_n(Q) is infinite, and n
#                     is congruent, and this direction needs no BSD. For n = 5 the point (-4, 6) is
#                     integral and on the curve, and its double is not integral, which proves it has
#                     infinite order and certifies n = 5 unconditionally.
#
# Positive control: Fermat's n = 1 recovered as not congruent by the exact count, and the point (-4, 6)
# verified on C_5 with the triangle (3/2, 20/3, 41/6) an exact area-5 right triangle. Two routes: n = 5
# certified congruent both by the infinite-order point and by the Tunnell equality; and each theta count
# taken twice over two different bounding boxes, agreeing. Drawn null: n = 1 and n = 3, where the count
# is unequal and the criterion correctly errors congruence, and a torsion point (on y^2 = x^3 + 1) that
# is integral and of finite order, the contrast to the infinite-order witness. Floor: the converse of
# Tunnell's criterion is conditional on BSD, and a bounded search for a triangle or a point bounds
# nothing about its absence.
#
# Prior art, named with respect. The problem is in Diophantus and the Arab manuscripts of the tenth
# century; Fibonacci found the n = 5 triangle and Fermat proved n = 1 is not congruent and introduced
# descent. The reduction to C_n and the group law are Poincare's and Mordell's (finite generation, 1922),
# on the chord-tangent construction of Diophantus and Fermat. Nagell and Lutz gave the integrality of
# torsion. Tunnell's criterion is J. Tunnell, "A classical Diophantine problem and modular forms of
# weight 3/2", Invent. Math. 72 (1983). The statement and its sets are Wiles's Clay description, read in
# full. Cited from that document and from memory of the literature; this file verifies only the exact
# integer and rational quantities and rests on no unread result. It adds no new mathematics.
