# The precision constants a number theoretic transform rests on, re-derived from the factorization of
# p-1 instead of tabled, and a wrong constant rejected by the same checks.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/ntt_twiddle_certificate.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. A number theoretic transform is exact only if its modulus is prime, its stated generator is
# a primitive root, and the root it builds twiddles from has order exactly the transform length. Each
# of those is a constant, and a constant taken on trust is a silent wrong answer waiting: the twiddle
# proof in theory/theory/cryptography/twiddle_constants/main.tex records two of them found in this project by
# running the check instead of reading the code.
#
# Three things are shown. First, the certificate: every modulus used here, the three device primes and
# the goldilocks prime from that paper plus the prime the image_transforms translation transform uses,
# re-derived from scratch. Second, the rejection: a composite of the same Proth shape and a false
# primitive-root claim error in the same checks that pass the real ones. The checks can fail
# and passing means something. Third, the floor: a root of HALF the required order passes every
# invariant computable from the table in O(n), and only the order test, two exponentiations, separates
# it. That is the paper's central result reproduced here (theory/theory/cryptography/twiddle_constants/main.tex, its section on a root of half the order and the only test that catches it).
#
# No bounding: no threshold is set here. Every verdict is an exact integer equality or inequality on
# unbounded Python integers, and the wrong cases are drawn instead of described.
