# A ladder of error-detecting and error-correcting checks, each catching a fault the one below it
# misses, every check on exact integers or exact bits, where a detection is real and never a rounding.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_check_ladder.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: arithmetic results shown working instead of a stage
# reading. It takes four checks the coding-theory and arithmetic fields already use and runs them one
# above the other. Each has a floor, a fault it cannot see, and the next check up the ladder sees that
# fault. The point of the ladder is the same as the point of the whole engine: a necessary condition
# loses nothing, and where it is blind, a second condition is added, never a tolerance.
#
#   casting out nines   n mod 9, from the digit sum. Catches a changed digit. Floor: a transposition of
#                       two digits leaves the digit sum. It is missed.
#   mod eleven          the ISBN-10 weighted sum mod 11. Catches the transposition nines misses, and
#                       every single-digit error. Floor: it detects, it does not locate or correct.
#   cyclic redundancy   a polynomial remainder over GF(2). Catches a burst of bit errors up to the
#                       generator's degree, which a digit check reads as one changed digit at best.
#   Hamming (7,4)       three parity bits over four data bits. Catches AND corrects a single bit error,
#                       naming its position. Floor: two bit errors defeat it, the reason the residue
#                       code beside this file adds redundancy for more.
#
# Positive control: clean data passes every check. Drawn null: each check is shown the exact fault it
# catches and the exact fault it misses. No bounding: every check is an integer or bit comparison, and
# the faults are constructed. None is sampled for a threshold.
