# The number theoretic transform applied twice turns the sequence around: NTT(NTT(x))[m] = n x[(-m) mod
# n], a reflection about the origin, exact in the integers modulo a prime. It is a wave inversion, and
# it is where the transform's boundary shows itself.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/ntt_double_transform_inverts.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. The transform is a sum over roots of unity, which are waves on the circle: X[k] = sum_j x[j]
# w^{jk} with w an n-th root of unity. Apply it a second time and every term collects into a delta,
# because sum_k w^{k(j+m)} is n when j+m is 0 modulo n and 0 otherwise. The second transform returns
# n times the original read backward from index 0. The forward transform is its own inverse up to that
# reversal and the scale n, and that is the exact reason the inverse transform runs the same butterfly
# with the reciprocal root.
#
# The boundary is real and it is here. The transform length n must divide p - 1, and for this prime,
# p = 998244353 = 119 * 2^23 + 1, the longest power-of-two length is 2^23. Past it there is no root of
# the needed order on this prime; a larger 2-adic prime (2^27 on the device primes, 2^32 on goldilocks,
# 2^48 in the twiddle paper) moves the boundary, and it is a choice of format, never absent. The
# transform is cyclic within that length: index n folds back to 0, the turn-around, and a
# convolution longer than n wraps into itself unless it is padded, the aliasing the translation example
# guards against.
#
# Prior art. The transform being its own inverse up to a reversal is the discrete Fourier transform's
# order-four structure: the DFT is an operator of order 4 with eigenvalues in {+1, -1, +i, -i}, and its
# square is the reflection or parity operator P with (P x)[m] = x[-m], the wave inversion shown here.
# See McClellan and Parks, "Eigenvalue and eigenvector decomposition of the discrete Fourier
# transform", IEEE Trans. Audio Electroacoust. 1972, and arXiv:0808.3214. The number theoretic transform
# is the discrete Fourier transform over a finite field, with the length condition n divides p-1 that
# fixes the boundary named above: Pollard, "The fast Fourier transform in a finite field", Math. Comp.
# 1971, and the survey arXiv:2211.13546. This example reproduces those results in exact integers and
# does not rest on them; the citation records that the property is known, not that it is assumed here.
#
# Positive control: NTT(NTT(x)) equals n times the reversed x, to the digit. Two routes: the double
# transform against a direct reversal, shown able to disagree. Drawn null: the claim without the
# reversal, NTT(NTT(x)) = n x, errors on a sequence that is not a palindrome. No bounding: the
# length, the prime and the root are declared, and every value is an exact residue.
