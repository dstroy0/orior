# A machine-to-machine transfer format whose wire is a vector of exact integer magnitudes, read the way a
# Turing machine reads a tape. Each cell of the vector is one instruction the receiver runs: a literal
# block to emit, or a unit and a count to emit that unit that many times. The count is an unbounded
# integer, one exact magnitude. A single small cell stands for an output too large to hold, and the
# receiver reaches any byte of that output by walking the tape instead of building it. This is the bit
# idiom on the wire: the payload is a magnitude, presence and extent, not a stream of fixed-width symbols.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/magnitude_vector_transfer.py
#           from the API:  tape = encode(payload); payload == decode(tape)
#           and without building the output:  output_length(tape), byte_at(tape, index)
#
# The tape. A cell is an opcode byte followed by its magnitudes. A magnitude on the wire is its byte
# length as an unsigned LEB128 varint, then that many big-endian bytes. A magnitude carries both its
# value and its extent, and a literal block keeps its leading zeros. Three opcodes:
#   HALT       end of tape.
#   LITERAL b  emit the block b verbatim. One magnitude carries a block of any size with no per-byte frame.
#   REPEAT u c emit the unit u repeated c times. c is an unbounded magnitude, and the span it names has no
#              ceiling, which is where the density comes from.
# The decoder is the machine: its head steps along the vector, each cell a transition that writes to the
# output tape. The encoder is the inverse, and it chooses REPEAT over LITERAL only when the repeat cell is
# smaller in wire bytes than the span it covers, a choice read off the two sizes and never a picked
# threshold.
#
# Positive control: encode then decode returns the input exactly, on a repetitive payload, a mixed one,
# a structureless one and the empty string. Two routes to the output: the decoder builds it and compares,
# and an independent walk computes its length and any single byte without building it, agreeing with the
# first on both the length and the sampled bytes. Drawn null: one byte of a tape flipped decodes to a
# different payload. A wrong tape is caught, and a clean roundtrip means something. Floor: density is a
# property of the payload instead of the format. A structureless payload has no repeat to name, falls to one
# literal, and transfers at its own size plus a few bytes of frame; the format claims no compression it
# cannot show, and the ratio is reported with its numerator and denominator on every case.
#
# No bounding: the only choice in the encoder, REPEAT against LITERAL, is decided by comparing wire sizes,
# and no tolerance or window size is set by judgment. The arithmetic is exact integers throughout and no
# float appears.
