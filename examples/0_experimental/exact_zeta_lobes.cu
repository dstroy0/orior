// The curves R holds at every point of a cell, and the logarithm the phase turns by, one lane a point, swept on the
// device as two programs of the record machine, one job on the device's tessera daemon. Every value is a mantissa in a
// register and a binary exponent the program holds: a product multiplies the mantissas and adds the exponents, a power
// of two is where a mantissa is laid in the record, and nothing is divided.
//
//   Usage:  exact_zeta_lobes <input> <output>
//
// Lane l stands at x = nu + l / 2^b, X = nu 2^b + l, and z = 1 - 2p = Zt / 2^b with Zt = 2^b - 2l. C_n(z) is
// sum over j of g_(n,j) z^j, each g a mantissa at the exponent -E, read by Horner's rule as the integer
// H_n = sum over j of g_(n,j) Zt^j 2^(b (J_n - 1 - j)) at the exponent -(E + b (J_n - 1)). The record holds each
// g_(n,j) 2^(b (J_n - 1 - j)), the mantissa laid b (J_n - 1 - j) bits up with zeros below, and each step of Horner's
// rule is then one product by Zt and one sum. With the sign s = (-1)^(nu - 1),
// the curve n's part of R x^(1/2) is s C_n(z) x^(-n) = s H_n 2^(b n) / X^n, and over the common denominator X^K every
// curve is the integer T_n = s H_n 2^(b n) X^(K - n), each at its own exponent, each held as an output.
//
// The logarithm: ln(x / m) = ln(nu / m) + A for every m, with A = ln(X / (nu 2^b)) = 2 artanh(l / D) and
// D = X + nu 2^b: one series a lane serves every term of the main sum, and ln(nu / m) is the cell's constant. With
// c_k = Lambda / (2k + 1), Lambda the least common multiple of the odd numbers below 2L, the first L terms of the
// series are 2 l S / (Lambda D^(2L - 1)) with S = sum over k < L of c_k l^(2k) D^(2(L - 1 - k)), an integer read by
// Horner's rule in l^2 against the powers of D^2. Every term is positive and each is below (l / D)^2 times the one
// before it: the tail past the last term is positive and below 2 l^(2L + 1) / ((2L + 1) D^(2L - 1) (D^2 - l^2)):
// A lies at or above the first quotient and below the first plus the second, and the stage holds the four integers
// l S, D^(2L - 1), l^(2L + 1) and D^2 - l^2 as its outputs.
//
// The input, little-endian: 64-bit words lanes, checked, nu, b, K, E, L, then K + 1 words J_n, then the mantissas
// g_(n,j), then the L constants c_k, each a 64-bit word count w and w 32-bit limbs of its magnitude least significant
// first, and a 64-bit sign word, -1, 0 or 1.
//
// The output, a stage at a time, R's curves and then the logarithm: the line "stage name out_limbs L", one line an
// output "output name offset bits exponent", one line a lane of L hex limbs, least significant first, the line
// "host 1" where the host's records over the first `checked` lanes equal the device's word for word, else "host 0",
// and the line "steps P compiled C".
