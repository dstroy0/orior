# The Bloom filter shown to be the orior's theorem in another field, and its floor measured
# and not assumed.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/bloom_is_the_sift_theorem.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: it is an algorithm shown working instead of a stage
# reading. When a Bloom filter runs over an actual corpus with its false-positive rate measured against
# a drawn null it graduates to any_corpus/5_sift; until then it is an idea that works.
#
# Two things are shown. First, the theorem: a Bloom filter never reports a member absent, for any choice
# of hashes, and only the false-positive COST moves with the choice. That is the anchor cascade's own
# result -- a necessary condition loses no true occurrence whatever rule selects it, and the rule moves
# only how many false candidates survive -- so the two are one object. Second, the honest measurement:
# the false-positive rate is not quoted from the formula, it is measured over items the filter never
# saw, and it is measured over STRUCTURED items and uniform ones both, because a filter that matches its
# formula on uniform data has shown you the formula and not the data.
#
# No bounding: the table size and the hash count are declared inputs, printed with every reading. The
# false-positive rate is a consequence of them, reported beside the formula's exact rational
# prediction, never a threshold set here.
