# The phase of the Riemann zeta function read finer than its reader: three sign verdicts give an eighth
# of a turn, and the same three verdicts under evenly spaced jitter give the phase to any fraction of it.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_phase.py [jitters]
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental and is an entry in the analytic number theory
# workbook, on its rail: it claims nothing about the Riemann hypothesis. It reads the phase at the
# points it is asked for and stops there.
#
# THE READER
#
# exact_zeta_zeros.py reads zeta at a point through three sign verdicts: the sign of the real part, the
# sign of the imaginary part, and the sign of |Re| - |Im|. Together they name the eighth of a turn zeta
# sits in. The reader never forms an angle and never divides.
#
# THE JITTER
#
# Rotate the value by j / J of an eighth turn for j = 0 .. J - 1 and read each rotation with the same
# three verdicts. With the phase u counted in eighths, reading j is floor(u + j / J), and Hermite's
# identity sums them exactly:
#
#     sum over j < J of floor(u + j / J) = floor(J u).
#
# The mean of J coarse readings is the phase to 1 / J of an eighth, an equality and not an estimate.
# Each jitter adds its verdict and none is discarded. The jitter has to be evenly spaced across one
# whole eighth: the same offset read J times returns the coarse reading J times, and offsets spread
# across half an eighth bias the mean toward the step they never reach.
#
# THE TURN BETWEEN JITTERS
#
# Euler's e^(ia) turns the value one way at a known rate, and across all J jitters it turns less than
# an eighth. The lifted reading is therefore 0 up to one crossing and 1 after it, and two jitters that
# read alike read alike at every jitter between them. The crossing is found by bisection in log2 J + 1
# readings in place of J, and the sum is J k0 + J - j*. Both routes run in the control and must agree.
#
# THE DEPTH
#
# The value is read at a count of places by exact_zeta_zeros.py's two routes, N doubling until they
# agree. The jittered index is read at those places and again at twice them, and the places double
# until the two indices agree. The reader cannot draw more out of a value than the value holds, and
# the depth each point needs is decided by that agreement instead of assigned in advance.
#
# THE LINE
#
# On Re(s) = 1/2, zeta = e^(-i theta) Z with Z real, and the phase of zeta is -theta up to a half turn.
# theta comes by a second route, Stirling's series in exact_zeta_gram.py, which shares nothing with the
# sign reader. Where Z changes sign the phase jumps a half turn, and each published zero falls inside
# a step where the jittered phase jumps.
#
# Positive control: e^(i pi / 3), whose phase is 4/3 of an eighth, read as floor(4J / 3) / J for every
# J; and the line against -theta. Drawn nulls: the repeated offset and the half spread, each blind to
# the third of an eighth above the step.
