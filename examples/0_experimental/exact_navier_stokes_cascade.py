# The Navier-Stokes solution map made visible on the unit torus: the energy cascade of a datum, shell by
# shell and order by order, and the growth of the Taylor coefficients whose limit is the reciprocal of
# the time the solution stays analytic. It reads the same sets exact_navier_stokes_on_torus.py defines,
# in the same integer arithmetic, and it claims nothing about any of Fefferman's four alternatives. It
# shows the knot; it does not cut it.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_navier_stokes_cascade.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. It imports the ring, the recurrence and Parseval from exact_navier_stokes_on_torus.py so one
# representation carries both files, and it adds no arithmetic of its own beyond a product of two exact
# quantities. Python integers are the bignum, representation.exact reads the viscosity, and the rest is
# booleans and comparisons. No float, no fraction library.
#
# THE PICTURE. A solution of (1), (2), (3) on the unit torus is carried as its Taylor coefficients at
# t = 0, u(t) = sum_m u_m t^m / m!. Each u_m is a field in the ring, a finite sum of modes with Gaussian
# integer Laurent coefficients in pi over one integer denominator. Two exact, pi-free readings of the
# cascade come straight off that:
#
#   the mode front   the count of modes k carried at order m, grouped by |k|_1. The product of two modes
#                    adds their index vectors. The front advances by exactly one in |k|_1 per order,
#                    and the count is a whole number at every shell. This is energy reaching finer scales
#                    order by order, read as integers.
#   the energy shell the energy an order deposits in the shell |k|^2 = r, an exact element of the ring
#                    (a Laurent polynomial in pi over an integer). Whether a shell carries energy is the
#                    exact test "is this quantity zero", which needs no numeric value of pi. The energies
#                    over all shells sum to the total, Parseval's identity, exact.
#
# THE KNOT. The regularity question is whether the solution stays smooth for all time. In this picture it
# is one quantity, the growth rate of the coefficients. That rate fixes the radius in t over which the
# series converges, and the radius is how long the solution stays analytic; a finite radius is a blowup.
# For the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress datum the rate is a single exact element of the ring, constant in the
# order. The series is e^{-4 nu pi^2 t} u_0, entire, and the datum never blows up. For a generic datum
# only finitely many orders are computed. Each bounds the rate from one side and no finite order reaches
# the limit. That is the completeness boundary of the precision document, the same shape as the horizon
# on the zeros of zeta in the analytic-number-theory workbook: a computation names finitely many to a
# stated precision and never reaches a statement about all of them. Reading the limit needs infinitely
# many orders and a step outside exact arithmetic, and neither is taken here.
#
# Positive control: the ABC datum's energy obeys the exact law E(u_{m+1}) = (16 nu^2 pi^4) E(u_m) at every
# order, its energy stays wholly in the shell |k|^2 = 1, and its coefficient rate is constant, the mark
# of the entire solution with infinite analyticity radius. Two routes: the per-order energy from the
# velocity coefficients and from the vorticity coefficients reconstructed by Biot-Savart, agreeing to the
# integer, and the Parseval decomposition summing the shells back to the total. Drawn null: the ABC datum
# does not cascade (energy stays in one shell at every order), the contrast that shows the generic
# cascade is a real feature and not an artifact; and a corrupted energy route, one mode dropped, is
# caught. Floor: finitely many orders, stated in the sentence that makes the claim.
#
# Prior art, named with respect. The equations and the sets are as named in exact_navier_stokes_on_torus.py,
# Fefferman's statement and Navier's, Stokes's and Euler's equations, with Beltrami, Arnold and Childress,
# Leray, Biot-Savart and Helmholtz credited there. The energy sum over modes is Parseval's. That the radius
# of the time-Taylor series is the interval of analyticity, and that a finite one is the first singular
# time, is classical: Foias and Temam on the time-analyticity of the Navier-Stokes solutions, and Kato.
# Cited from memory of the literature, unread here, and this file verifies only the exact per-order
# quantities and rests on no unread result. This file adds no new mathematics.
