# Turing's method, run as a machine over the automata of exact_zeta_turing.cu. Each automaton is a fixed program of
# the record machine, checked against the host word for word; this machine sits one level up, runs them a cell at a
# time, joins what each cell returns to its neighbors', and halts with a count proven or a cell it could not close.

#
# For each run of the device it writes the device's input to a file in a temporary directory and reads the device's
# output back.
#
# It sits in 0_experimental and is an entry in the analytic number theory workbook, on its rail: it verifies the
# zeros up to a height it is given and says nothing past it.
#
# THE CELLS
#
# Cell nu holds the points t = 2 pi s, s = x^2 = nu^2 + j (2 nu + 1) / P, j below P = 2^p: even in t, and in theta
# to within 1 / nu across the cell. P is the least power of 2 that gives the cell `rate` points or more for each unit
# theta / pi rises across it, each zero's share. The device works out every value of the cell itself, from nothing
# but nu, p and constants that do not depend on nu: ln k and k^(-1/2) once for each k <= nu, theta / pi and the
# remainder term once for each point, each point's main sum over k <= nu, the sign of Z it certifies, the zeros it
# finds between certified signs, and the sums of Turing's method over the cell's two ranges about its first certified
# point F. A cell returns F, its last certified point, its point 0, and those sums.
#
# THE MAIN SUM
#
# By pairs, the device takes each point's nu terms one lane apiece, nu P lanes a cell. By the multiple evaluation of
# Odlyzko and Schonhage, it takes F_j = sum over k of a_k exp(-2 pi i j pos_k / P), a_k = k^(-1/2) exp(-2 pi i nu^2 ln k),
# pos_k = (2 nu + 1) ln k, at every point at once: F is the discrete Fourier transform of
# u_h / P = sum over k of q_k / (z_h - w_k), a sum of nu poles on the unit circle at the P roots of unity z_h, which a
# tree of multipole and local expansions of order ORDER over leaves of 2^BETA frequencies evaluates, with each leaf's
# near poles taken whole through the Dirichlet kernel; the main sum's half is Re(exp(i theta) F). Its lanes a cell
# grow as P, not nu P. With both, the device runs the two and writes the most their Z differ by over the cell.
#
# THE BOUND ON Z
#
# Z = 2 sum + (-1)^(nu - 1) x^(-1/2) C_0 + E, |E| <= 0.127 t^(-3/4) for t >= 200: Gabcke's bound, as Hiary, Patel and
# Yang state it (An improved explicit estimate for zeta(1/2 + it), Lemma 2.1). theta is
# (t/2) log(t / (2 pi e)) - pi/8 + 1/(48 t) + E_theta, |E_theta| <= (7/5760 + pi/960) t^(-3) + exp(-pi t) / 2
# (Brent, On asymptotic approximations to the log-Gamma and Riemann-Siegel theta functions, Theorems 5 and 6), and
# an error in theta moves Z by at most 2 sum of m^(-1/2) <= 4 nu^(1/2) times it. The device's own error, a unit of
# 2^-62 a division and a unit a constant, is bounded step by step in `arithmetic`, and the multiple evaluation's, its
# truncation with it, in `transform_error`. A sign of Z is certified where |Z| exceeds the sum of the three.
#
# By Euler-Maclaurin, Z = sum over n < N of n^(-1/2) cos(theta - t ln n) + Re(exp(i theta) N^(-s) C), with N and the
# Bernoulli terms M chosen for the cell, and Johansson's bound on the remainder, which holds at every t > 0
# (Johansson, arXiv:1309.2877, Theorem 1): `em_bounds`.
#
# THE CELLS BELOW 168 PI
#
# With em, cells `first` to `last` run by Euler-Maclaurin, from cell 1 up, and N at cell `last` + 1's F, T_a, is held
# by Riemann-Siegel over cells `last` to `last` + 2. Where the certified sign changes in (cell `first`'s F, T_a] number
# N(T_a), every zero up to T_a is on the line and simple.
#
# THE COUNT
#
# Two certified points of opposite sign, with no certified point between, hold a zero of Z between them: a zero of
# zeta on the line. N(t) = theta(t) / pi + 1 + S(t) off the ordinates, and for t_2 > t_1 > 168 pi,
# |integral of S from t_1 to t_2| <= 2.067 + 0.059 log t_2 (Trudgian, Improvements to Turing's method, Theorem 2.2).
# On a lattice step [t_i, t_(i+1)], theta lies between its ends, and the zeros certified past T are at most
# N(t) - N(T). Over a window after T, N(T) <= 1 + B / (2 pi D) + sum of d_i (Theta_(i+1) - c_i) / D, and over one
# before it N(T) >= 1 + sum of d_i (k_(i+1) + Theta_i) / D - B / (2 pi D), with d_i the steps of x^2, D their sum,
# c_i the zeros certified in (T, t_i] and k_(i+1) those in (t_(i+1), T]. N is a whole number.
#
# The sum of d_i c_i is the sum over those zeros of x^2 at the window's end less x^2 at the zero's later point, and
# the sum of d_i k_(i+1) the sum of x^2 at the zero's earlier point less x^2 at the window's start. A cell's count
# of zeros and its sums of x^2 at their ends carry the whole of both. Every step of x^2 in cell nu is (2 nu + 1) / P,
# the one from its last point to the next cell's point 0 too, and that one weighs theta / pi at point 0.
#
# THE MACHINE
#
# N is held at F of every cell, with the window back to F of the cell before and the one on to F of the cell after.
# A cell whose certified zeros fall short of the difference of N at its F and the next cell's F, and the cells about
# an F where N is not held to one value, are run again on a lattice four times finer, and the counts are taken again. Where every cell closes, every zero from the second
# cell's F to the last cell's is a certified sign change: on the line, and simple.
#
# Positive control: the device's Z at two points of the first cell against the house's main sum and remainder,
# exact_zeta_riemann_siegel's rs_cut_at; by Euler-Maclaurin, against its em_at, and at cell `last` against
# Riemann-Siegel's Z within the two bounds.
