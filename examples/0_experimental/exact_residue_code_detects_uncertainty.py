# An existing error-correcting code, the redundant residue number system, run on exact integers, where
# a disagreement it flags is real uncertainty and never a rounding artifact.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_residue_code_detects_uncertainty.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. It takes a code the coding-theory field already uses and points it at this engine's job. A
# residue number system carries an integer as its remainders against a set of pairwise coprime moduli,
# and the Chinese remainder theorem reconstructs the integer from them. Adding REDUNDANT moduli past
# the ones the value needs turns the representation into a code: a single number reconstructed past its
# declared range is a residue that disagrees with the rest, and an error shows itself. This is the same
# capability as a Reed-Solomon code, correcting half the redundant moduli's worth of errors.
#
# Two things this pairing gives that neither half gives alone. First, RANGE without a fixed width: the
# exact integer the system holds is the product of the moduli, and every modulus added multiplies that
# range, and a single modulus near 2^40 widens the exact range by more than a trillion, without end.
# Second, DETECTION that cannot cry wolf: because every residue is an exact integer and nothing rounds,
# a nonzero syndrome is a real disagreement. The code detects genuine uncertainty and never its own
# arithmetic. That is the protein session's enantiomer case stated as a code: two independent exact
# measurements compared residue by residue agree exactly or name where they differ, and a rounded
# compare would have merged them.
#
# Positive control: a clean codeword reconstructs inside its range and no error is flagged. Two routes:
# the error is caught two independent ways, by the range test and by recomputing the redundant residues,
# and both name the same position. Drawn null: a batch of clean codewords raises zero false alarms.
# Stated floor: two redundant moduli correct one error and detect two; a third error defeats them, and
# the example shows the floor by injecting past it.
#
# No bounding: the moduli, the information count and the redundancy are declared inputs, printed with
# the run. No threshold decides an error; the range test is an exact integer comparison.
