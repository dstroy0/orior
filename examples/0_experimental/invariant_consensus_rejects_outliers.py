# Reject outlier correspondences by an invariant the inliers share: the orior's theorem on a
# compatibility graph, which is ROBIN.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/invariant_consensus_rejects_outliers.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an algorithm shown working, a robust-estimation
# filter beside the signal ones. The medium is new -- a graph whose vertices are MEASUREMENTS and whose
# edges are pairwise compatibility; the technique is new to this tree, but the theorem is the same
# one the anchor cascade already proves.
#
# The setup is ROBIN's (arXiv:2011.03659): two integer point sets are related by a rigid motion, and
# correspondences pair a point in one with a point in the other. The inliers are the true pairs; the
# outliers are wrong pairs. A rigid motion preserves distance. For two inlier correspondences the
# distance between the two source points equals the distance between the two target points. That is the
# invariant, and it is checked pairwise as an exact integer equality of squared distances, without ever
# solving for the motion. Two inliers always satisfy it. The inliers are all mutually compatible and
# form a CLIQUE; an outlier satisfies it with an inlier only by accident. Rejecting the outliers is
# finding the clique.
#
# The guarantee is one-directional, the family's signature: the inliers are a clique by construction and
# are never split out, and an outlier survives only by joining the clique by accident, a false candidate
# and never a lost true one -- the same shape as the anchor cascade losing no true occurrence and the
# Bloom filter never reporting a member absent.
#
# Two routes bracket the answer: the maximum clique is tight and the k-core is the cheap relaxation that
# contains it. Both retain every inlier and the k-core admits more outliers, the
# soundness-versus-cost split again. A broken compatibility that links everything is run beside them to
# show the rule moves cost and leaves correctness alone. The null is drawn by shuffling the correspondences, which
# destroys the rigidity so no large clique remains. The floor is stated: when outliers conspire into a
# consistent set LARGER than the inliers, the largest mutually compatible set is theirs, and the
# necessary condition cannot tell a large accident from the truth.
