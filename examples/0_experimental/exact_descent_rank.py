# A descent by 2-isogeny on the congruent-number curves y^2 = x^3 - n^2 x, giving a sound rank UPPER
# bound in exact integer arithmetic, pinning the rank exactly where an explicit point's lower bound
# meets it, and where it cannot, reaching the first part of the Tate-Shafarevich group: the exact classes
# that are locally soluble everywhere yet come from no rational point. It is the workbook's open item on
# Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, done as a bound and an exhibited obstruction, not a claim about the conjecture.
#
#   Usage:  python examples/0_experimental/exact_descent_rank.py
#
# This reads no corpus. It sits in 0_experimental: an arithmetic result shown working instead of a stage
# reading. The arithmetic is the engine's own: Python integers as the bignum and exact residues mod
# p^k, no float, no fraction library, no math library. The elliptic-curve group law used for the lower
# bound is imported from exact_congruent_number.py so one representation carries both files.
#
# THE METHOD, AND WHY IT IS SOUND. The rank of E : y^2 = x^3 - n^2 x satisfies
#   rank E = dim_2 Sel(alpha) + dim_2 Sel(alpha') - 2,
# where alpha, alpha' are the two descent maps of the 2-isogeny phi : E -> E' with E' : y^2 = x^3 + 4 n^2 x,
# and Sel is the Selmer group, the square classes d whose torsor C_d : w^2 = d u^4 + f z^4 (f = b/d, with
# b = -n^2 for alpha and b = 4 n^2 for alpha') has a point over R and over every Q_p. The image of the
# descent sits inside the Selmer group, and dim Sel over-approximates it, and the bound is therefore a
# sound UPPER bound on the rank: it can never fall below the true rank. It is exact, equal to the rank,
# exactly when the 2-part of the Tate-Shafarevich group vanishes; where that group is nontrivial the
# bound is honestly loose, and n = 17 below is that case.
#
# LOCAL SOLVABILITY AS A REFUTE-ONLY PROBE, WITH NO PICKED BOUND. A square class starts admitted, in the
# Selmer group, and is dropped only when a probe holds a certificate that its torsor has no point over R
# or some Q_p. The probe is one-directional, the engine's own discipline: it can only refute, on a
# genuine obstruction, never falsely admit, and dropping a class only ever moves the count in the safe
# direction (a class wrongly kept inflates the bound, which keeps it an upper bound). The real place is
# an exact sign condition: w^2 = d u^4 + f z^4 has a real point iff d > 0 or f > 0. The p-adic decision
# is Hensel, with the level DERIVED from the form and not picked: a solution modulo p^k with the
# Jacobian of the form having p-adic valuation j at that point lifts to a genuine Q_p point once
# k >= 2 j + 1 (the strong Hensel condition), and the absence of any lifting residue up to the level the
# form's own valuations force certifies insolubility. The recursion lifts residues digit by digit; a
# level whose survivors all die is a certificate of insolubility, a lifting survivor is a certificate of
# solubility, and the two exhaust the cases below the derived level. There is no judgment cap anywhere.
#
# Positive control: the bound reproduces the known ranks over a table of n covering rank 0 and rank 1,
# and stays a sound upper bound (never below the rank) on every one. Two routes: the descent upper bound
# and an explicit rational point's lower bound, which meet to pin the rank exactly for the pinned n.
# Controls on the probe itself, in place of a null (there is nothing to permute in a rank bound, the
# orior engine's note): a torsor known soluble is certified soluble and one known insoluble is
# certified insoluble by branch death, which shows the refute-only probe fires only on a real
# obstruction. Floor: the bound is exact iff the 2-part of Sha vanishes; n = 17 is the demonstrated gap,
# where the first descent gives rank <= 2 while the rank is 0. That gap is not left as a floor but
# reached: with rank 0 established unconditionally by Tunnell (A(17) != 2 B(17), no BSD), the descent
# image is the torsion image, and the leftover dual-side Selmer classes 2, 17, 34 are exhibited
# nontrivial elements of Sha, each certified locally soluble and coming from no rational point. The
# validation covers rank 0 and rank 1, and rank-2 congruent numbers are large and outside it.
#
# Prior art, named with respect. The descent by 2-isogeny, the Selmer and Tate-Shafarevich groups, and
# the torsor form are classical: Mordell and Weil for finite generation, Cassels, Tate, and the standard
# treatments in Silverman's "The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves" and Cremona's "Algorithms for Modular
# Elliptic Curves". Hensel's lemma gives the lifting and the derived level. The congruent-number curve
# and its descent are worked out in Silverman X.6. Cited from memory of the literature, unread here; this
# file verifies only the exact integer quantities and rests on no unread result, and it validates the
# derived level against its own reproduction of known ranks. It adds no new mathematics, and it claims
# only a rank upper bound and nothing about the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.
