"""Find the same code written twice, when it was written twice under different names.

  dedup.py fns   [PATH ...]   whole functions that share a shape
  dedup.py block [PATH ...]   runs of statements inside functions that share a shape
  dedup.py shape [PATH ...]   the shapes themselves, largest group first: the reusable patterns
  dedup.py show  <shape-id>   one shape in full, canonical form and every site that has it

A textual diff cannot see this. Two units that both walk a table looking for a match write the same
five statements with `i`/`n`/`e` in one and `loculus`/`count`/`ent` in the other, and a hash of the text
puts them in different buckets. So the text is not what is hashed. Comments come off first through
readclean's own pass - the literal-aware one, not a regex - the result is tokenized, and every
identifier is replaced by the position at which it was first seen. Two blocks that differ only in
what things are called then reduce to the same token string and land in one bucket.

Three renaming strengths, because they answer different questions:

  --rename all     every identifier goes, types and callees included. Answers "is this the same
                   shape", and it found one idiom written out forty-eight times.
  --rename vars    an identifier immediately followed by `(` keeps its name, and so does anything
                   in ALL_CAPS, which in this tree is a macro. Answers "is this the same algorithm
                   over different data" - the calls and the widths still have to line up. Default.
  --rename none    nothing is renamed. Exact clones only, and the baseline the other two are read
                   against: a group that appears under `vars` and not under `none` is one the eye
                   would have to have caught by name.

Statement order is not required to match. Every unit carries two hashes: the token sequence, and the
multiset of its statements with each statement hashed on its own. Two blocks holding the same
statements in a different order collide on the second and not the first, and are reported as a
reorder instead of a copy, the case a sequence hash silently misses.

  --min N      the fewest tokens a unit may hold to be reported (default 24 for fns, 12 for block)
  --win N      statements in a block window (default 4)
  --nums       fold integer literals to one token as well
  --json       machine-readable, for a script that wants the groups instead of the report
