# Write the binary sound representation of every held recording.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/analysis/sound/binary_sound.py [<stem> ...]
#
# Reads build/audio/ and writes build/sound/<stem>.bits.tsv, one row per 10 ms frame: the time, the
# segment field, and the prosody field. archive/src/python/includes/formats/representation/sound/perceived_sound.py
# carries the method and says why it has the shape it has.
#
# A GENERIC TOOL, AND THE CORPUS IS WHAT IS WITHHELD
#
# This reads any recording. Nothing in it knows a language, and the method is the same for a field
# recording, a podcast or a bird. Withholding a generic tool protects nothing, because whoever has
# audio can write one.
#
# The corpus not being shipped is what prevents casual misuse. Writing this file is the easy half.
# Gathering the recordings and cleaning them into something measurable is the hard half: the hand
# extraction behind this work is 12,338 rows read off published pages by a person over months, and
# no amount of code shortens that. A tool with nothing to point at is a tool nobody can casually
# point at somebody's speech.
#
# So the control is to leave the hard part hard. Publishing the corpus would convert months of
# somebody's reading into a download, and every casual misuse downstream starts with that download
# existing. Not shipping it keeps the cost where it already was.
#
# It is deliberately only casual. It stops the easy path and does not pretend to stop somebody who
# does the gathering themselves and means it.
#
# What the run prints is the delta. The thresholds are cut so every bit splits the frames in half
# and the axes are rotated so no bit restates another, the sample brought to the highest
# entropy it can carry, with every state reachable. A recording that then used all of those states
# evenly would be noise. The gap between that reference and what the recording actually does is the
# structure in it, and it is measured with the same total variation and entropy the corpus work
# uses, out of orior.py.
#
# The support figure keeps the delta honest. A 24 bit field has 16.8 million states and a
# twenty minute recording has 135 thousand frames. Most states are unreachable at this sample
# size whatever the recording does. The delta against uniform is therefore near 1 on the wide field
# by construction, and the entropy against the field width is the reading to take.
#
# So the segment field is also reported at the narrow widths where its states are sampled. The bits
# come out of a rotation ordered by how much the recording varies along each axis. The leading
# ones carry the most and a prefix of the field is the best code of that width. At 12 bits a
# recording of this length has 33 frames per state, and a delta measured there is a fact about the
# recording. At 24 it is a fact about the frame count.
