#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/analysis/survey/papers_probe.py
#
# Everything measured here has been measured before, language by language, by people identifying
# languages and attributing authorship for their own reasons. What is worth taking from that work is not
# its conclusions but its settings. A paper that reports the character run length it settled on for
# Chinese, or the one it settled on for Finnish, has measured something about that language and written
# it down as a configuration.
#
# Those settings are a fact about the language whether anyone treated them as one. An
# agglutinative language with long words needs longer runs to reach a morpheme than an isolating one
# does. A logographic script needs shorter ones because a single character already carries what an
# alphabet defines. If the settings across many papers line up with what kind of language each is
# about, that is a constant nobody set out to publish.
#
# This asks only what the archives serve and how they may be queried. Nothing is downloaded and no claim
# is made about what is in them.
