# Put every corpus through the gate and write down the verdict, for Section 4.13 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/analysis/survey/gate_sweep.py
#
# The gate stops a dirty file being measured, but only where a reading calls it, and a check each tool has
# to remember is the same check that was forgotten before. So the sweep is run once over everything and
# the answer is written to a file. A reading then consults the verdict instead of repeating the check, and
# a corpus that has never been through the gate is visible as one with no verdict.
#
# Its catches are worth stating plainly, because two of these were found by accident and cost hours
# each. A Greek to English lexicon standing in a Greek corpus. Untranslated English in seven Indic files,
# from 1.8 to 30.0 percent, which inverted a whole language family and drew three explanations before
# anyone looked. Neither is exotic and neither announces itself.
#
# Nothing is deleted or changed on disk. The manifest says what each file is, and a reading decides what
# to do about it.
