# Score every banned pattern against human technical writing, and against both arms of this tree.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/prose/ban_evidence.py [--worst N]
#
# docs_check carries 242 patterns and every one of them got there because somebody noticed it.
# That makes the list a record of what was noticed. This asks what the list is claiming: that these
# phrases are the machine's and not a person's.
#
# prose_distance.py asked the same question with a distribution and could not answer it. The gap
# between the arms was the same sign at all four symbol widths and cleared no floor at any of them,
# because a banned phrase is a rare event and total variation is carried by the bulk. A rate is the
# right instrument for a rare event.
#
# THE TWO ARMS, AND THE ONE THAT WAS WRONG
#
# papers      154 research papers under build/papers, 7.3 MB, human, same register
# repository  every comment, docstring and page in this tree
#
# An earlier arrangement split the repository by whether this session had opened a file, and called
# the untouched half a person's prose. That split is void: the text of this repository is almost all
# machine-written, across many sessions. Both halves had the same author. It explains the null
# prose_distance.py returned, where the gap between those halves was the same sign at four symbol
# widths and cleared no floor at any of them. There was no contrast in it to find.
#
# The papers are the only human arm available, and they are the whole control here.
#
# WHAT A ROW MEANS
#
# Rates are per hundred thousand words, because most of these phrases are rare enough that per
# thousand rounds everything to zero. A pattern that fires in the papers is a pattern describing
# ordinary technical English, and banning it costs a writer a phrase they are entitled to. A pattern
# that never fires in 154 papers and fires in the machine arm is doing the job the list claims.
#
# This does not decide anything on its own. A pattern can be absent from the papers because the
# papers are linguistics and the phrase belongs to systems programming. The output is evidence for
# reading, and the last column says which way each pattern leans.
