# Tests for the register stages of docs_check: the two tiers, what stands behind each one, and
# the reporting text.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/prose/test_docs_check_tiers.py
#
# THE FIRST TEST IN THIS FILE IS THE GOVERNING ONE. The two SKILL.md files ARE the standard. A gate
# that reports either of them on vocabulary is wrong by construction, whatever it found. That
# one assertion catches the whole over-reach class without anybody enumerating it, and it is why
# thirteen bare word bans came out of the table instead of thirteen exemptions going in.
#
# Read the note above docs_check.AUTHORITY before changing anything here. The tier a pattern is in
# is decided by the sentence in the standard and never by the shape of the regex.
#
# Every count asserted here is derived when the test runs. A constant is correct on the day it is
# written and wrong on the day the tree moves, and hand-carried numbers in this tree have been wrong
# repeatedly. Where a fixture is pinned to a revision, the revision is printed with whether it is
# reachable from anywhere but this machine.

    TIER B is vocabulary. A TIER B hit on one of these files is the checker telling the author of
    the standard that his own word choice is machine prose, and the document he wrote is the thing
    that decides what machine prose is. It is always wrong. That is asserted at zero.

    TIER A is a construction each document bans in a sentence. A TIER A hit on one of these files is
    the document using a construction it bans, which is a real finding about real prose and is the
    author's to decide. Eleven stand on code-documentation/SKILL.md and eight on
