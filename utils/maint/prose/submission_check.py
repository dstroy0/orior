#
# THE RULE THIS SERVES
#
# CONTRIBUTING.md:8 states a condition as non-negotiable, and it is the only one there: a tool for
# language that comes out of this work requires a human to review its output, and a contribution
# that removes a person from that loop is not accepted. CONTRIBUTING.md:30 then lists three checks,
# prose and the kernel and the ports, and not one looks at the condition that comes first.
# Somebody pasting generated text into a Salishan form is a person removed from the loop, and
# nothing in the tree caught it.
#
# IT REPORTS. IT DOES NOT DECIDE, AND IT MUST NOT BE WIRED AS ONE
#
# A scanner that errors on a contribution on its own automates away the human that CONTRIBUTING.md:8
# requires, in the name of enforcing that rule. Nothing here prints pass, fail, accept or reject,
# and the exit status reports what was found and never what to do about it. Do not put this in a
# hook that rejects. Whoever wires it up next will not have read the conversation this came out of.
# The constraint is written here for that reason, where they will be looking.
#
# The numbers below are evidence for a person, and a person can look at any of them and say the
# contributor writes that way. A contributor who does is not doing anything wrong.
#
# TWO SURFACES
#
# A name. Generated text pasted in whole tends to carry the vendor's own name somewhere, in a
# preamble, an error, or a stray line of chat. That is the cheap surface and it catches the
# careless case only.
#
# A register. This surface carries the measurement. utils/maint/prose/docs_check holds 285 patterns and,
# for 121 of them, the rate a human research writer uses them at, counted over 759,815 words of
# the papers under build/papers. Those rates are imported from that file and never restated here.
# Their sum is the rate a human carries for the whole list. The baseline this compares against
# is derived from the same table the findings come from and cannot drift away from it.
#
# WHAT THE RATES ARE COUNTED OVER, WHICH DECIDES WHETHER THEY MEAN ANYTHING
#
# A rate is per hundred thousand words. The denominator here is a count of letter runs in the prose
# of the submission, after docs_check.prose_only has removed code, math and markup. The human rates
# were counted over english_gate's output instead, which is stricter: it drops the interlinear
# glosses, the orthography and the tables that fill a Salishan paper.
#
# For a submission that is English prose the two denominators are close and the ratio is worth
# reading. For a submission that is mostly a table, a word list or IPA, this count runs high, every
# rate runs low, and the comparison says little. The word count is printed for that reason. Read it
# before reading the ratio.
#
# A LOW NUMBER IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING
#
# The rates are a floor and only a floor. A contributor who knows the list can write around it, and
# the phrases were suppressed in this tree's own prose while the human corpus was being counted.
# A submission scoring near the human rate has told you nothing except that it scored near the
# human rate.
