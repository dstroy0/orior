"""The ASD-STE100 check: every technical document checked against the Simplified Technical English writing rules.

One file, the same in orior, MMgr and embedded_types; orior's harness holds the three copies byte for byte.

    ste_check.py [paths]                    the findings in every technical document under the paths
    ste_check.py --ratchet FILE [paths]     fail where a document carries more findings than FILE allows it
    ste_check.py --ratchet-write FILE ...   write each document's count into FILE, lowered and never raised
    ste_check.py --words FILE ...           the approved word lists, one word a line or a word in a TSV's first
                                            column; a word outside every list is a finding

A technical document is a Markdown file of the tree's prose: the README, the contributing and security notes and
everything under docs/, but not in a folder that is a repository of its own. A code block, an inline span of code, a table, a heading, a link target, an HTML comment
and a license section are not prose and are not read.

The rules checked, with their numbers in ASD-STE100 Issue 9:

  sentence     a procedural sentence, a numbered step, has 20 words at most (Rule 5.1); a descriptive sentence
               25 at most (Rule 6.2)
  paragraph    a descriptive paragraph has 6 sentences at most (Rule 6.6)
  ing          no -ing form of a verb, but in a technical name (Rule 3.6)
  passive      the active voice in every sentence (Rules 3.7 and 3.8): a form of `be` before a past participle
  tense        the simple tenses only (Rule 3.4): no `have` or `has` before a past participle, no `be` before an -ing
  word         every word is an approved word or a technical name (Rules 1.1 and 1.5), where an approved list is
               given; a technical name is a word in code, a capitalized word or one with a digit or an underscore

The words a rule allows are technical names to that rule, and each repository lists them in ste_names.txt beside
this file and its ratchet: a name like `string` is a technical name, which Rule 3.6 lets keep its -ing.
