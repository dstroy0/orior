# The text goes to build/voice/text/ and never into the tree: it is the books' text. The tree
# keeps voice.tsv, the words and their counts, which voice_count.py writes from it.
#
# Each title is converted from one PDF. The folder holds scans of the same lectures beside the
# editions with a text layer, and a title counted twice would count every word in it twice. The
# scans are left out, and so are the two excerpt volumes (Six Easy Pieces and Six Not-So-Easy
# Pieces reprint chapters of the Lectures), the older edition of Feynman's Tips, the second version
# of the Volume 2 PDF, and the Lost Lecture, whose text is the Goodsteins'.
#
# The Lectures on Computation are left out as well. Their fonts carry no map to Unicode, and every
# extractor tried (pdftotext, pdftotext -raw, pypdf, pypdfium2) gave 34 to 40 percent of the words
# in accented letters that stand for other characters, with the letters between them misread too.

# position and splits a word wherever the glyphs are spaced apart: in QED that gave "p hoton" and
# "throug h", and 94.78 percent of its words were known to the other texts against 98.43 with -raw.
