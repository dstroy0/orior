"""Does the text remember? Mutual information against lag, and the shape of its decay.

THE QUESTION, AND WHY A FILE-LEVEL DISTANCE CANNOT ANSWER IT

`machine_distance` places a file between a human pole and an machine pole and prints its own
limit at the foot: every file-level distance is a bag of words, and so it reads COMPOSITION and
never ARRANGEMENT. A bag of words is invariant under permutation - shuffle the corpus and every
count is identical - and so it cannot separate a text from its own shuffle, and it cannot say WHICH
sentences carry the register. That is not a flaw in the tool, it is what a bag of words is.

The gap is what this measures. Generated text is close to MEMORYLESS: it is sampled token by token
from a context window, and so its long-range structure is whatever that window carries. Human
writing is not memoryless. A person holds a subject across paragraphs and returns to it, and so
dependence survives to ranges no window covers.

So the discriminator is not a score, it is a SHAPE: how fast dependence dies as the gap grows.

THE STATISTIC

Mutual information between the token at t and the token at t+k, swept in k:

    I(k) = sum over (x, y) of p(x,y) log2( p(x,y) / (p(x) p(y)) )

I(k) is zero exactly when the two positions are independent. Lin and Tegmark measured this shape for
natural language against Markov sources and found the separation is in the DECAY LAW: natural
language falls off as a power law, while anything with a bounded context falls off exponentially and
hits the floor. A power law is straight on log-log; an exponential is straight on log-linear and
drops off a cliff. That is a shape a curve can show and a single number cannot.

This is the same instrument as `bench_walk`'s autocorrelation sweep over lags 1 to 1024, pointed at
text instead of nonces, and it answers the same question: does this thing carry anything across a
gap, or does it forget.

THE NULL IS FREE AND IT IS DRAWN, NOT DERIVED

Estimated MI is biased UPWARD at finite sample: with V*V cells and limited counts, independent data
still produces a positive number, and the bias grows as the table gets sparse. Deriving that bias is
possible, and this tree has a rule against it: a derived bar comes out too low, always in the same
direction.

So it is measured. Shuffling the tokens destroys arrangement and keeps every count identical, and that
makes a shuffle EXACTLY the memoryless surrogate for this statistic. The floor at each lag is what
the shuffle produces at that lag, drawn several times. What gets reported is the excess over that
floor. A decay to zero means decay to where this corpus at this size can no longer tell.

THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS THE POINT, NOT AN EXTRA

Both poles already exist in the tree, and their existing is what this builds on in place of renting.
Human research papers are one, the machine's own transcript is the other. If the human corpus does
not show a heavier tail than the machine corpus, the instrument is not measuring what it claims
and no reading from it means anything. That check runs first and its verdict gates the rest, the
same way pi in the compressor gates a compression claim.

WHAT BOUNDS A READING

The decay law is the right discriminator and long-range dependence is real in natural language: a
null from this instrument is a statement about its power at a given corpus size instead of about the
effect. Three nuisance parameters bound that power, and each one has a control.

LENGTH. MI bias grows as a corpus shrinks: every comparison is made at the shorter pole's length. At
that length the human decay slopes form a band, and only a separation wider than that band is
reportable. The band narrows as the root of the length: more text is the way forward instead of a better
statistic. `--band` draws the human band at a chosen `--length`.

THE UNIGRAM DISTRIBUTION. The excess at any one lag carries the estimator's bias: a bare LEVEL
compares two estimators wherever the unigram distributions differ. The hypothesis is about SHAPE
instead of level: dividing each curve by its own value at lag one removes the scale the bias sets, and a
power law and an exponential differ in how they fall whatever that scale is. `--twoband` gives both
poles a band at a common length and measures the confound alongside.

ASSEMBLY. `load_papers` concatenates about 120 separate documents, and different papers use different
words at different rates: composition drifts across the joins, and drift raises MI at every lag.
Knowing where you are in the corpus tells you which document you are in, and therefore which words
are likely. That is a fact about how the corpus is built instead of about the writing. Document count and
join rate set a corpus's large-lag excess on their own.

SEPARATING DRIFT FROM DEPENDENCE

Drift and real dependence come apart exactly. `--scramble` shuffles the tokens inside every window of
100, which destroys all arrangement shorter than 100 words while leaving composition above that
scale untouched: real dependence at lag 256 cannot survive it, and drift is unaffected by it. Where
the large-lag excess survives the scramble, the tail is drift, not a long-range signal.

The inversion is worth stating plainly, because it reverses the premise the line starts from. A
continuous single-author work is the arm with the LEAST large-lag excess; concatenated corpora have
the most. Large-k excess tracks how a corpus is assembled and is close to silent about the writing
inside it.

WHAT A NULL ON THE SHAPE MEANS

A wider machine spread is itself evidence against the mechanism, not a failure to detect it. The
hypothesis says generated text is closer to memoryless: its decay should be tighter and steeper, and
a spread wider than the human band argues against the mechanism directly. Every word of the
machine pole is written under this tree's ban list, which suppresses its register in the direction
that works against a separation. A null on the shape is therefore ambiguous about unsuppressed
prose, though the spread argument does not depend on the suppression.
