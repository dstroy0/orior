"""Grade the repair table itself, because nothing else does.

`prose_fixes.tsv` is a find-and-replace table applied to source files. Two faults in it are
invisible everywhere else, and one of each was live when this was written.

FAULT ONE: A REPLACEMENT THAT IS ITSELF BANNED

Line 20 replaced `is exactly the` with `is precisely the`. Both are banned by `docs_check` - the
first at its line 63, the second at line 85 - so the rule carried a banned phrase from one form
to another and reported success. It survived because its target is a `.h`, and the docs gate blanks
code. The file the rule edits is a file the gate does not read. A repair table that can introduce
the thing it repairs is worse than no table, because the run comes back clean.

FAULT TWO: A REPLACEMENT THAT DELETES A WORD AND LEAVES A HOLE

A rule whose replacement drops a word can leave a sentence ungrammatical, and NO gate can see it: a
broken sentence still renders, contains no banned token, and is therefore neither breaking nor
prose. Found in the tree, all from this shape:

    `is the one to take seriously`  ->  `is the to take seriously`
    "what remains after every"      ->  "what remains every"
    "the arm whose arithmetic"      ->  "the whose arithmetic"

The mechanism is always the same. Text was written with a banned token inside it, a rule removed the
token, and the sentence around it was never re-read. The repair cannot be to restore the word, since
that restores the ban; it has to be a rewrite, which a table cannot do.

So deletions are not banned here - sometimes dropping a word IS the correct repair - they are
REPORTED, every one, for a human to read the resulting sentence. The check is that someone looked,
not that the rule is forbidden.
