# Prose lives in pages, in comments, in the research papers and in the build, and the same voice writes all
# four.
#
# .tex belongs here because the research papers are the longest continuous prose in the tree and
# the only part written to be read straight through. Leaving the extension out leaves them unread.
#
# BUILD FILES BELONG HERE FOR THE SAME REASON. A comment in a CMakeLists.txt makes the same claim a
# comment in a header makes, in the same voice, to the same reader. An extension this tuple cannot
# open reports "0 file(s) checked" and exits 2, which reads like a pass.
#
# AN EXTENSION AND A PATTERN HIDE A SITE TWICE, and that is the trap to watch for. A form the
# locale stage already names is hidden once, by the extension list. A form no pattern reaches is
# hidden twice, by the extension list AND by the pattern being too narrow. Adding the extension
# alone makes the first kind fire, which reads as coverage, and leaves the second kind invisible
# further down the same file. Both halves are needed to see either, which is why they are one pass.

# The C family as this tree actually writes it. Naming .c and .h alone names the two extensions
# the tree barely uses and omits the two it is written in: against 3 .c and 9 .h there are 205 .cu
# and 3 .cpp, and every one of them carries argued note blocks in the same voice as a header.
# prose_only needs nothing added for them, since it falls through to the C comment branch for any
# extension it does not name and that branch is already right for CUDA.
#
# .html is here for the same reason and reads the same way: the view templates carry their argument
# in the `//` and `/* */` comments of their script blocks. A `<!-- -->` comment is NOT read, and
# this tree writes none. Neither is the visible text of a page, which wants a tag stripper.
