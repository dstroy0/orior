# LOCALE is spliced in and is the single copy of the British patterns. The order of the groups is
# the order a hit is reported through: where two patterns overlap a site, whichever group BANNED
# reaches first names it. Reordering these changes which pattern a finding is attributed to. GRAMMAR
# comes last, and a site an older group already names keeps that name.

# ====================================================================
# WITHDRAWN: THE UNBOUNDED WORD BANS THAT ARE DELIBERATELY NOT IN FORCE
# ====================================================================
#
# Named rather than left absent, because an absence reads as an oversight and gets filled in. Every
# entry here is a bare word ban that must not be added, with the rule that excludes it.
#
# THE RULE THAT EXCLUDES THEM. code-documentation section 143: "a word that reads as a tic in one
# construction only is bounded to that construction: paradigm shift is banned where paradigm is
# not." And the escape immediately before it: "A term the field owns stays."
#
# THE TEST IS MECHANICAL. Neither standard bans any of these. Both standards USE eleven of them as
# ordinary technical English, in the same documents that authorize this checker:
#
#   carries      code-documentation:145  "carries this list as regexes"
#   holds        code-comments:208       "holds the list as regexes"
#   reads        code-comments:208       "reads .c and .h comments and docstrings"
#   spends       code-documentation:84   "it spends a reader's trust before it wastes their time"
#   buys         code-documentation:85   "breaks the line the prose is walking and buys nothing"
#   construction code-comments:199       "are essay construction, not comment construction"
#   costs        code-documentation:108  the register a rule applied wrongly costs a paragraph
#   carry        code-documentation:104  "A documented pointer with no token is an unanswered
#                                        question"; :161 "correct when carried by a real name"
#   slot         code-comments:195       "Name a Handle by Its Slots" -- a handle slot is this
#                                        tree's own term of art, named in a section heading
#   earns        code-documentation:114  "each one earned its place by measurement"
#   book         code-documentation:158  "A name already sitting in the tree is not evidence"
#
# A bare ban on any of these flags the standard that authorizes this checker, in the standard's own
# running prose, outside any code span. A rule that reports the document stating it is transcribed
# wrong.
#
# WHY NONE OF THEM CAN BE BOUNDED THE WAY paradigm shift IS. The construction they read as a tic in
# is an inanimate subject taking a human verb, and no regex separates it from the correct technical
# use. "The header carries the checksum" and "the buffer holds the segment" are the right verbs in
# a network stack, and they are character for character the shape a bare ban is after. What IS
# bounded is the is-what-VERB construction near the head of this tuple, which both standards name,
# and that is where these belong.
#
# THE COST OF GETTING IT WRONG IS RECALL, not precision. A bare ban on this class buries a report
# under correct technical English, and the true findings go down with it. Measure per word before
# adding one: the weight sits on hold, carry and read, and a ban on those three alone can be the
# majority of a whole report.
#
# Each entry is the word, what it was after, and the sentence that removed it.
