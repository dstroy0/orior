# ====================================================================
# THREE GROUPS, AND WHAT STANDS BEHIND EACH
# ====================================================================
#
# PLAIN is read from voice_plain.tsv, one pattern a row. Each row is a phrase the NARA Writing Style
# Guide names, the plain form it gives, and its section. The pattern is the phrase as a run of words
# with any whitespace between them, so a phrase broken across two lines is still one phrase. The
# replacement comes from the guide and the oracle prints it: `--pick=plain` reads the same table. TIER A,
# cited to the section.
#
# CONSTRUCTIONS are rules of the guide that take a shape instead of a list:
#
#   2.3.3  a hidden verb: make, provide, perform or conduct carrying an article and
#          a noun in -ment, -ion, -ance or -ence. "made the decision" for decided.
#   2.3.5  a false subject: "It is clear that", "There are several issues that need".
#   1.5.2  a hyphen after an -ly adverb: "recently-received".
#   2.5.5  manner, fashion, way or basis carrying an adjective: "in a timely manner".
#
# These are TIER A, cited to the section. They fire in human papers too, and the guide bans them
# for every writer.
#
# ISMS are this tree's own: sentence shapes the machine's prose carries at many times the rate of
# the reference papers. Each is TIER B, reported with its rate in those papers. No standard names
# them. The measurement in grammar_evidence.py is their only warrant:
#
#   X, not Y.                  a contrast hung on the end of a clause
#   What it does is            the pseudo-cleft, a sentence that announces its own predicate
#   no X, no Y, and no Z       the negated triple
#   , which makes              a which-clause carrying the consequence of the last clause
#   Here's                     a sentence opened by pointing at what follows
#   is about X, not Y          the contrast in its topic form
#   that is deliberate         a clause that vouches for the sentence before it
#   instead of just            the contrast with a minimizer
#   : nothing.                 a colon and a one-word verdict
#   nothing more, nothing less the closing flourish
#
# GRAMMAR_RATE counts each pattern per 100k words of GRAMMAR_CORPUS. That text is every paper under
# build/papers, ungated: the glosses and the orthography stay in the denominator, and every rate
# here reads low by the share of the words that are not English. Re-measure after changing a
# pattern; a rate measured against another pattern is a rate for nothing.
