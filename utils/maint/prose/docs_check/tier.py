# ====================================================================
# THE TWO TIERS, AND WHAT DECIDES WHICH ONE A PATTERN IS IN
# ====================================================================
#
# TIER A is a NAMED-CONSTRUCTION BAN: a construction one of the two standards bans in a sentence,
# quoted below with the file and line it is on, or a phrase or construction the NARA Writing Style
# Guide names in a section, cited by the section in grammar.py. Tree-wide, no opt-in, no per-repo setting, every hit
# a finding. A per-repo switch on this tier would exempt a repository from a standard it is already
# under, which is backwards: the standard is the tree's, not each repository's.
#
# TIER B is FREQUENCY-SCORED VOCABULARY: a word or an idiom, reported with what it costs a human
# writer where that has been measured. Most of it is the machine-prose vocabulary code-documentation
# section 135 through 141 lists by word. The rest is this file's own house style, calibrated on
# orior's theory research papers and named as such in the report.
#
# THE TIER IS DECIDED BY THE SENTENCE IN THE STANDARD, NEVER BY THE REGEX. This is the correction
# that matters and it runs both ways:
#
#   `rather` is one token and matches one word. Stage_of calls it a word. Its ban is stated
#   outright at code-documentation:110 and again at code-comments:200. It is TIER A.
#   `\bis what (separates|keeps|...)` is a construction by shape and by authority alike, and the
#   verbs this file added to it beyond the standard's ten are TIER A all the same, because the
#   construction is the thing banned and the verb list is how far it reaches.
#   The X-not-Y patterns span several words and are TIER A. The superlative-adjective group spans
#   several words too and is TIER B, because section 137 lists adjectives.
#
# WHAT THE TIER CHANGES. Nothing about whether a run passes: prose never fails a build in either
# tier, --strict included, and the exit rule at the foot of main() is the whole of that contract.
# It changes what the report says, and it is the line an autofix would have to respect.
#
# A BANNED HINGE IS DISSOLVED, NEVER REPLACED. There is no --fix here and there must never be one
# for TIER A. code-documentation:110 bans `rather`; its obvious repair is the X-not-Y shape, which
# section 146 bans forty lines later in the same document: "The X-not-Y shape sounds decisive and
# carries almost nothing... State the thing that is true and let the contrast go unsaid, unless the
# reader would otherwise land on the wrong one." An automatic repair of the first rule produces the
# second at scale and reports a fix for every one. The two legal treatments are to give the second
# half its own plain sentence, or to drop the weaker half, and section 146's test decides which. A
# machine cannot run that test. Section 143 says the same thing from the other side: bans name
# CONSTRUCTIONS. Detection AND repair operate on constructions and never on words. TIER A is
# report-only, permanently. A token-for-token orthographic swap is the only class an autofix could
# ever own here, and that is the alphabet stage and not this table.
