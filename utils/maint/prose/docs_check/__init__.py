# What the prose standard says, checked instead of remembered.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/prose/docs_check [root]
#
# Every check here is a defect that reaches a reader as a broken page. None of them is a matter of
# taste.
#
# AND IT ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS A REPAIR ASKS, which is the other half of being usable. A gate that
# names a fault and cannot say what belongs instead leaves the writer guessing, and a guess is how
# a repair introduces the next finding. readings.py holds them and USAGE lists them: --pick asks
# the voice oracle what this writing puts in a place, --offlist names every word in the tree the
# oracle does not approve, --show prints the lines the findings sit on, --slack says which ratchet
# ceilings nothing reaches, and --holes reads a diff for sentences a repair broke.
#
# Four instruments answer the same way: --rate (rate.py), --plain (plain.py), --sample (sample.py)
# and --harmonics (harmonics.py). None of the four is imported here. harmonics.py pulls numpy in and
# resolves the repository with git when it loads, and a scan that asked for none of them would pay
# for that on every run. readings.py imports each one at the moment it is asked for.
#
# EXIT STATUS. 0 when nothing breaking was found, 1 when something breaking was, 2 when no file was
# read at all, 3 when a file rose above its ratchet ceiling, 4 when the run was asked for something
# it cannot do. Never a count: counts wrap at 256, and 256 findings would report success.
#
# Prose findings print and exit 0. A hook nobody can satisfy is a hook somebody turns off, so only
# the tier that stops a commit reaches the status. Ask the instrument, do not model it, and that
# applies to this header as much as to anything else.
#
# WHAT THIS TOOL IS TO THE REST OF THE TREE. Both writing standards name it by path and hand it the
# list: code-documentation section 145 and code-comments section 208. Where it is kept is not what
# it governs. The table is the standard for every .md page, every .py, .c and .h comment and every
# .tex body in every repository here.
#
# THE TWO TIERS. Read the note above AUTHORITY for the rule that assigns them and for why the regex
# never decides. TIER A is a construction one of the two standards bans in a sentence, tree-wide
# with no opt-in. TIER B is vocabulary, scored against what it costs a human writer where that has
# been measured. Neither fails a build, in any repository, --strict included.
#
# THE FAULT THIS TABLE KEEPS MAKING runs in both directions and is a transcription failure rather
# than a judgement one. A rule is read for its EXAMPLES and coded as a list, or read for one
# INSTANCE and coded as a bare word. Against the first, code-documentation:143 states the escape:
# "a word that reads as a tic in one construction only is bounded to that construction." Against
# the second, :149 states the British ban as a pattern and means the shape, not the ten words it
# names. Transcribe the sentence, not the illustration beside it.
#
# A RULE TABLE DUPLICATED INTO THE TABLE THAT ENFORCES IT DRIFTS WITH NO SIGNAL AT ALL. LOCALE is
# spliced into BANNED and there is one copy. Keep it that way.
#
# Cite the sentence and not only the number: a number moves when a document is edited and the
# sentence is the rule.
# Re-check every rule against the sentence that states it, and run the standards' own illustrations
# through the checker, since a rule that misses its own example is a rule transcribed wrong.
