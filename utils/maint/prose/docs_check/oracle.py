# The voice oracle: which words this body of writing uses, and which words it puts next to which.
#
# THE TABLES DECIDE A WORD AND NOTHING ELSE DOES. voice.tsv is the approved word list, counted over
# the research papers, and voice_word_web.tsv is every adjacent pair in them. A word absent from
# voice.tsv is not a word of this voice however well it reads, and a pair absent from the web is a
# juxtaposition this writing does not make. Both are read here and neither is edited here: a count
# is evidence about the corpus and changing one to suit a repair falsifies the only instrument that
# can judge the repair.
#
# project_words.tsv is the second word list: the names and the mnemonics of this project, which the
# research papers do not hold. It carries no counts. Its words are the author's, one row each with
# what kind of word it is, and like voice.tsv it is read here and never written here. counted() joins
# the two into one dict, and a project word carries the count 0, which is its true count in the
# corpus.
#
# The readings are deliberately narrow. `pick` answers what goes in a place and `offlist` answers
# which words in the tree have no warrant, and between them they cover the whole of what the tables
# can say. Anything wider would be this file having an opinion.
