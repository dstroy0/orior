# Count every grammar pattern per 100k words of the reference papers, and of any text named beside them.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/prose/grammar_evidence.py [TEXT ...]
#
# The papers column, for ISMS, is GRAMMAR_RATE in docs_check/grammar.py, printed as it is written.
# Each TEXT named gets a column of its own: the machine's prose from session_prose.py, or the plain
# text of a tree from docs_check --plain. A pattern earns a place in ISMS when its rate in the
# machine's prose stands well above its rate in the papers.
#
# Every text is read the way the checker reads a file: lines joined into runs at blank lines, each
# pattern compiled with IGNORECASE. A rate counted another way is a rate for a different pattern.
#
# The papers are read whole and ungated, glosses and orthography included, and GRAMMAR_CORPUS says
# so wherever a rate is printed.
