#
# WHY A POSITIVE CONTROL CHANGES THE QUESTION
#
# Every earlier attempt here had one pole. english_sift scores a text against ordinary English,
# ban_evidence scores a phrase against 154 human papers, prose_era dates a text against six decades
# of them. All three ask how far a text sits from something human. None of them can say what it
# sits near instead, and a detector with one pole is a detector that can only ever report a
# distance from normal.
#
# utils/maint/prose/fixtures/machine_reference.md is the other pole. It is a page written deliberately
# in the machine register, at full strength, by the machine, about the work being done in this
# repository. Matching the subject makes it usable, because it is not a distance to a 1667 epic or
# to a linguistics paper. Genre, locale and era are all held fixed and the only thing left free
# to vary is the register.
#
# THE SPLIT boundary_check ALREADY USES
#
# Two poles, and every file joined to whichever it is nearer. There is no threshold in that and no
# label anybody supplied: a file's verdict is which of the two references it resembles more, and
# the margin between the two distances says how firmly. The papers are the human pole.
#
# WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS WRONG
#
# The positive pole is one page by one writer on one day. It is a sample of the register, not the
# register, and a file can sit near it for sharing a subject and not a voice. The margin column
# is there for that: a file inside the resolution reported at the foot is not placed by this, and
# the honest answer for it is that nothing was read.
#
# The fixture must never be repaired. docs_check skips the directory holding it for that reason,
# and repairing it would delete the only positive sample the instrument has.
