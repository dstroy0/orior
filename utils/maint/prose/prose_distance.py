# Score this repository's own prose against English, on the bench that already measures English.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/prose/prose_distance.py [<root> ...] [--worst N]
#
# WHAT THIS ANSWERS
#
# docs_check bans 242 phrases and every one got there because somebody noticed it, and that makes
# the list a record of noticing. The question underneath it is whether this tree's prose reads like
# English somebody wrote. That question already has a bench: english_sift.english_reference builds
# a byte pair reference from four megabytes of ordinary English plus the in-domain English nine
# readers marked by hand, and english_sift.surprise scores a text against it in bits per pair.
# This points that bench at the repository, with the research papers beside it to fix the scale.
#
# TWO EARLIER ARRANGEMENTS WERE WRONG AND ARE RECORDED SO THEY ARE NOT REBUILT
#
# The first used Shakespeare, Milton, Austen and the King James Bible as the human arm. A distance
# from technical documentation to a 1667 epic is a distance between two registers, and it would
# have been read as a distance between two writers.
#
# The second split this tree by whether the current session had opened a file, and called the
# untouched half a person's prose. That split is void: the text of this repository is almost all
# machine-written, over many sessions. Both halves had one author. It explains the null the
# distributional form of this script returned, where the gap between those halves carried the same
# sign at four symbol widths and cleared no floor at any of them. There was no contrast in it to
# find, and a measurement that cannot fail is not a measurement.
#
# The research papers are the human arm. 154 of them, linguists writing for linguists, the same
# register as the documentation under test and out of the same PDF pipeline.
#
# WHAT A NUMBER MEANS
#
# Surprise is mean bits per byte pair. Lower sits closer to English. The papers fix the scale. A
# repository file inside the papers' own spread reads the way a human technical page reads, and one
# above all of them does not. Nothing here is a verdict on a sentence: it ranks files by how far
# they sit from English, which says where to look, and a person still reads the file.
