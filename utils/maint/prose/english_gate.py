# Keep the English of a mixed corpus and drop the rest, leaving a comparison that is about English.
#
#   Usage:  from english_gate import english_only, english_words
#           python utils/maint/prose/english_gate.py            (reports what the gate removes)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT CORRECTS
#
# Three measurements in this directory used the 154 research papers under build/papers as their
# human English pole. Those papers are linguistics: every one carries Salishan orthography,
# interlinear glosses, IPA and tables of forms, and a large share of their tokens are not English at
# all. Comparing anything against that corpus measures how much language data a text prints before
# it measures how anybody writes.
#
# It showed up as a result each time and was explained away instead of fixed:
#
#   prose_distance      reported this repository as closer to English than the papers, and the
#                       reason was that the papers are not English.
#   machine_distance   put the Salishan extraction scripts furthest from the machine pole. They
#                       were matching the papers on Salishan instead of on register.
#   ban_evidence        divided phrase counts by a word total padded with non-English tokens.
#                       Every per-100k rate it reported was low.
#
# prose_era did not have the fault, because it counted ASCII words only. This is that fix, taken out
# of one file and made shared, and applied to both sides of every comparison.
#
# THE GATE IS TWO STAGES AND NEEDS BOTH
#
# Line stage. A line has to look like writing and has to score inside the English cut on the bench
# that already measures English. That removes a page of Mandarin and a page of shifted font codes,
# which are both un-English and only one of them is worth knowing about.
#
# Word stage. What the line stage leaves is cut to runs of ASCII letters. A gloss line reading COP=3SBJ
# D/C=NMLZ=STAT passes the line stage, because it is written in letters and is short, and it is not
# English. Restricting to ASCII words drops the orthography, the IPA and the Greek outright, and the
# stop lists in the callers drop the language names that survive as ASCII.
