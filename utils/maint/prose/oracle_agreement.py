# Ask whether the label on a fetched corpus carries any information.
#
#   python utils/maint/prose/oracle_agreement.py           the verdict and the numbers behind it
#   python utils/maint/prose/oracle_agreement.py --quiet   the verdict alone
#
# WHAT THE QUESTION IS
#
# fetch_machine_prose.py takes community uploads that all claim one model generation. Nobody
# can verify that from the outside: a label on a public dataset is a claim by whoever uploaded it,
# and a corpus of some other model's output under that name would look the same from here.
#
# Independent uploads make the claim checkable without trusting any of them. If corpora that
# all claim one model resemble each other more than any of them resembles a corpus known to be
# something else, the label is carrying information. If one sits as far from its own siblings as it
# does from the control, it is either mislabeled or a different register, and a pole built out of
# all of them is a pole built out of two things.
#
# This is the oracle pattern the rest of this work uses, over labels instead of over measurements.
# The agreement is the evidence, and no single corpus is trusted to speak for itself.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT ANSWER
#
# It cannot say the label is right. Uploads of the same mislabeled corpus agree perfectly,
# and so do corpora of different models that happen to share a register. It
# catches the ordinary failure: one upload among several that is not what the others are.
#
# The control matters for the same reason. Against a control too close to the subject the
# separation vanishes and nothing is shown. The control here is the human pole, the furthest
# thing in this tree from machine prose and the pole the distance instrument already
# measures against.
#
# THE CORPORA ARE DATA AND ARE NEVER READ
#
# Third party text off a public host. It is counted and measured, and no line of it is printed.

    of it holds.
