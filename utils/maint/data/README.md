# data

**Purpose:** Say what belongs in this directory and what does not, leaving a new script one obvious place.
**Scope:** `maint/data/fetch/`, `maint/data/salishan/`.

**Everything here operates on external material.** Getting it, and turning it into something measurable. Nothing here measures anything, and nothing here reads the engine.

The membership rule stops there. A script that fetches, converts, transcribes or repairs somebody else's material belongs here. A script that reads a corpus and reports a number belongs in `maint/analysis/` or `examples/`.

## fetch

Network acquisition, one script per source. Each names the archive it reads, identifies itself in its user agent, and writes under `build/corpora/`.

They range from a single work to a whole archive: Project Gutenberg, OPUS, Deutsches Textarchiv, Aozora Bunko, Universal Dependencies, Tatoeba, eBible, and the Estonian and Austrian national collections.

## salishan

One subject's pipeline, from the archive to a checked corpus. This is the largest single thing in the repository and it is a data pipeline instead of a tool. It sits here under its own name for that reason, instead of inside a directory called tools.

| | |
|---|---|
| `get_papers.py`, `paper_supervisor.py` | the ICSNL archive, and tracking every paper from index to converted text |
| `pdf2png.py`, `draft_page_text.py` | a page as an image, and as a first draft, for the papers whose extracted text is not what the page prints |
| `extract/` | a paper drafted into an oracle table and finished against its page: `oracle.py STEM start` repairs the text layer, sorts it with the English sift and drafts the table, its ops and the per-paper generators, finish contexts and tables, which stay in the closed corpus, finish it, and `residue.py` holds every row to the paper |
| `hand_extraction/` | the control. Forms read off a page by a person, and the checks that grade a reader against them |
| `corpus_script_extraction/` | the readers, one per paper |
| `orior_algorithmic_extraction/` | the sift applied to the same papers |
| `corpus_derivation.py` | how wrong the corpus could be, from what the checks have seen |

The papers, and every text read off their pages, are not here. They are somebody else's copyright and somebody else's language, and they stay in the closed corpus, which the tools reach through `build/papers` or `ANCHOR_SIFT_PRIVATE`. The oracle tables the experiments read are at `examples/Salishan/oracles`, and `extract/workdir.py` names where each of these is.
