# Extract the Central Salish lexical suffixes Julie Wolfe compares in ICSNL 60.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_wolfe.py
#
# Written for one paper, and this one is a different shape from every other paper here. The others
# are a story told by one speaker in one language. This is a comparative reconstruction: every form
# in it is a lexical suffix cited from a published dictionary of one of eighteen languages, laid out
# in columns under a two-letter abbreviation for the language it came from.
#
# THERE IS NO SINGLE PURE STREAM FOR THIS PAPER
#
# Every other reader writes a .pure.txt holding one language. Pouring these forms into one file
# would build a corpus of Sliammon, Sechelt, Squamish, three kinds of Halkomelem, three kinds of
# Straits, Klallam, Lushootseed, Twana, Tillamook, Quinault and two Tsamosan languages together,
# which is a corpus of no language at all. The language is what the orior is trying to measure.
# Mixing eighteen of them into the thing it measures against is the mistake that cannot be
# recovered from downstream.
#
# So this writes .pure.tsv instead, with the language in the first column. A reader downstream picks
# the language it wants. The hand extraction carries the same information in its who column, the
# column reader_check grades against.
#
# WHAT IS HELD OUT
#
# Reconstructions. A form marked with a star is what the author works out that PS or PCS must have
# had, and nobody has ever said one. That is the same distinction salish_marking draws between a
# transcription and a segmentation line, applied to a proto-form.
#
# Predicted reflexes. Tables 6 and 8 give, for each language, the form expected if the reconstruction
# was stressed, the form expected if it was not, and the form actually attested. The extraction does
# not keep the columns apart reliably. Every cell of those two tables is held out. Nothing is lost:
# the attested forms of both tables are also printed in examples (1) and (6), where the columns are
# unambiguous.
