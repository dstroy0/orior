# Report the shape of an extracted paper, an extractor can be written against it.

#
# Every paper read so far has defeated an assumption carried from the one before it, and each failure was
# silent. Garcia numbered its third story differently from its first two and that story came back empty.
# Matthewson's footnote markers matched a bare number heading and cut a section from thirty-four blocks to
# two. Alexander's story sits entirely in subsections. Reading the bare numbers returned two appendices
# and none of the narrative. LaFontaine writes ł where others write ɬ, and that makes every token invisible.
#
# All four were visible in the shape of the file and none of them were visible in a summary of it. This
# reports the shape: the headings, how many numbered blocks sit under each section, whether timestamps
# appear, and which characters the paper writes the language with. An extractor is built against
# that, and it is far less to read than forty pages.
#
# Nothing is extracted here and nothing is decided. A heading that looks wrong in this report is a heading
# that will be wrong in the extractor.
