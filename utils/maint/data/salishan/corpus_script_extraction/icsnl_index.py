# The conference has met every year since 1966 and the University of British Columbia posts the whole run,
# with the volumes from 1966 to 1999 held as the Kinkade Collection and the rest published since. That is
# fifty and more volumes of description of a family with no annotated corpus anywhere, and that makes the
# archive the corpus.
#
# The links are pulled out of the page here instead of through a summarizer, because a summarizer given a
# page of links returns prose about the links and drops the addresses, which it did on the first attempt at
# this page. The addresses are the only part that matters.
#
# Nothing is downloaded by this. It writes the list and stops, since the run is several hundred megabytes
# and what to take from it is a decision instead of a default.
