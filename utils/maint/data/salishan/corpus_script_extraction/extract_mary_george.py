# Extract the Mainland Comox of Mary George and the other speakers in ICSNL 56, following that paper's own
# structure.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_mary_george.py
#
# Written for one paper. This one holds fourteen separate narratives, each its own numbered section with a
# title and a date, and it is not all one speaker. Mary George told most of them between 1969 and 1980.
# The Mink story is Noel George Harry's, the basket ogre is Tommy Paul's, and the last is John Hamilton
# Davis's own. Attributing all of it to Mary George would be wrong about three of them. The speaker is
# a column and is set per section.
#
# Every utterance appears twice: once in the community orthography and once as a phonetic transcription in
# square brackets, followed by an English translation. So square brackets mean something different in this
# paper than in Alexander and Davis, where they hold material the linguist inserted. Here they hold the
# same utterance written a second way, and both are records of what was said.
#
# The pure stream takes the community orthography and not the phonetic line, because the two are one
# utterance and writing both would put every sentence into the stream twice. The phonetic line is kept in
# the marked file with its own kind. A reader who wants Davis's ear instead has it there.
#
# Notes sections carry his commentary on particular lines and are derived.
#
# Mary George approached Davis and his wife at a film showing in the community hall at Sliammon in 1969
# and offered to teach him the language. That is how this material exists.
