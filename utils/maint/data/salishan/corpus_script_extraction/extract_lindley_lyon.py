# Extract the Upper Nicola Okanagan of twelve narratives from ICSNL 48, repairing the font substitution
# first.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_lindley_lyon.py
#
# Written for one paper. Twelve stories, and unlike the others in this set its subsections carry
# names: Okanagan, Interlinear gloss, Free translation, Commentary. Three of the twelve are three
# tellings of one story and three more are three tellings of another, each with its own commentary.
# The section numbers do not line up with the story count, and reading them positionally misfiles the
# versions against each other. The subsections are matched on their titles instead.
#
# This paper carries the same font substitution as the other Lyon volume, and the same table was
# tested against it independently: before the mapping, 2 tokens of 4332 were attested in Lyon's later
# papers on this language; after it, 965. That table is applied here and recorded in the output. A
# reader can then see the text passed through a transformation, and check the mapping.
#
# The appendix holds a note on transcription and glossing practice and two pronominal paradigm tables.
# Those are the language and they are not narrative. They are kept and marked derived.
