# Extract the Okanagan of three speakers from ICSNL 50, repairing the font substitution first.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_lyon_priests.py
#
# Written for one paper, and this is the only one so far whose characters had to be repaired before it
# could be read at all. Its font wrote plain letters in place of the orthography. The text arrives as
# iP naPì ʼqwQaylqs where it should read iʔ naʔɬ ʼqwʕaylqs.
#
# The mapping was tested instead of assumed. font_substitution.py applies a candidate table to the damaged
# tokens and counts how many become forms attested in Lyon's recent papers on the same language, whose
# extraction kept its characters. Before the mapping, 1 token of 3599 was attested. After it, 811. The
# same table tested on the other damaged Lyon paper moved 2 of 4332 to 965. A wrong mapping cannot do
# that, because a wrong substitution produces strings the language does not contain.
#
# What the table does not cover is recorded with it. The caron entries are written by this font as a
# separate character before their letter. X̌ arrives as ˇx, and the order of replacement matters.
#
# Three speakers, and the permissions are named in the paper. Conversation with the priest was told by
# George Lezard of the Penticton Indian Reserve in 1966 when he was eighty-five, recorded by Randy
# Bouchard and transcribed by Larry Pierre in 1970; Lyon updated that transcription with the permission of
# Arnie Baptiste, Larry Pierre's son. Smokey and the priest is Nellie's, reprinted with the permission of
# her great-granddaughter Lynne Jorgesen of the Upper Nicola Indian Band. The third story's teller is
# named in its own introduction, which this reports so the attribution comes from the paper.
