# Extract the two Salish letters from Robertson's Chinuk pipa study, ICSNL 47.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_robertson.py
#
# Written for one paper. The paper is a history and structural analysis of the Chinuk pipa
# shorthand, and it prints six texts written in that script by Indigenous writers around 1900. Two
# of the six are Salish and four are Chinook Jargon.
#
#   Text 1  Nɬeʔkepmxcín, a letter by Charley Alexis Mayoos, published in Kamloops Wawa in 1893
#   Text 2  Secwepemctsín, the parting salutation of a letter by William Celestin
#   Texts 3 to 6  Chinook Jargon, which is a pidgin
#
# Only the first two are target-language material. Chinook Jargon is a language of its own and a
# pidgin besides. Nothing from Texts 3 to 6 or from the phonological analysis reaches the pure
# stream. Those lines are kept in the record and flagged, never dropped.
#
# TWO THINGS THIS PAPER DOES THAT NO OTHER ONE HERE DOES
#
# The transliteration line is written in plain ASCII. Mayoos wrote in shorthand and Robertson
# transliterates it letter for letter. The line reads o l ha l kukpi, and carries not one
# character of the modern orthography. The character test every other reader here leans on calls
# that line English. It is Nɬeʔkepmxcín, and the only thing that says so is where it sits. The
# pipa rows are marked T by position and never by their letters.
#
# The extraction breaks words across lines with no hyphen, 42 times. Some of the breaks fall inside
# a gloss: A above UG-, s above ick, gr above eet. joined() puts those back. It errors on the join
# where the line under the fragment is itself short, because the alphabet tables set the Chinuk pipa
# letter names wa, wi and waw one to a line and joining those would invent words.
#
# WHAT THE SOURCE STILL LOSES
#
# Labialization. Page 30 sets /kʷú[·kʷ]piʔ and the text gives /kwú[·kw]pi. The raised w is gone and
# a plain one stands where it was. This reader writes what the file holds and the hand extraction
# carries what the page prints. theory/theory/Salishan has the measurement.
