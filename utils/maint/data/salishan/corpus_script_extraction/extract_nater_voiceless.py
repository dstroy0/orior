# Extract the voiceless Bella Coola words Hank Nater lists in ICSNL 59.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_nater_voiceless.py
#
# Nater's argument is that Bella Coola has words with no vowel in them. His data is 127 numbered
# entries that are each a run of two to four consonants with a gloss. That layout is the easiest in
# the set to read and the hardest to tell from English by character, because an entry like kp 'each,
# all, every' carries no mark of the orthography at all. What identifies an entry here is its
# position: a number in parentheses at the head of a column.
#
# WHAT IS NOT BELLA COOLA
#
# Six of the numbered entries, (128) to (133), are Heiltsuk. Tables 6 and 7 put Oowekyala, Kwak̓wala,
# Haisla, Sechelt, Lillooet, Upper Chehalis and Tsimshianic forms in a column beside the Bella Coola
# ones, and Heiltsuk, Oowekyala, Kwak̓wala and Haisla are North Wakashan, which is a different family
# entirely. A reader that took the whole page would build a Nuxalk corpus holding Wakashan words.
#
# So the entry number decides: 1 to 127 is Bella Coola, 128 to 133 is Heiltsuk, and the etymology
# tables are read for their Bella Coola column alone. Everything else goes to the unclassified file
# for a person to sort, which is where a form belongs when a tool cannot say whose it is.
#
# THE CLUSTER CHARTS ARE NOT WORDS
#
# Tables 2 to 5 are every two-member voiceless cluster the language allows, about two hundred cells.
# They are Bella Coola phonotactics and they are not words anybody said. They stay out of the pure
# stream. The hand extraction records them under the kind "cluster" for the same reason.
