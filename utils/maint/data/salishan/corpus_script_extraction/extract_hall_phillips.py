# Extract the nɬeʔkepmxcín of Bev Phillips from ICSNL 60, following that paper's own structure and its own
# glossing categories.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_hall_phillips.py
#
# Written for one paper. This one is laid out differently from the Garcia narratives: it has no inline
# sentence numbering and no per-story subsections. Section 2 is the story in nɬeʔkepmxcín with a timestamp
# above each sentence, section 3 is a running English translation, and section 4 is a four-line interlinear
# gloss under the same timestamps.
#
# The paper describes its own gloss format: the top line is the surface transcription, the second segments
# each word into morphemes in underlying form, the third glosses each morpheme, and the fourth translates.
# So the first line of a block is what she said and the lines under it are analysis of it.
#
# Sentences in section 2 wrap across lines of the PDF between timestamps. The lines between one
# timestamp and the next are one sentence and are joined. Treating each line as its own sentence made the
# later line overwrite the earlier one and dropped the front of every long sentence.
#
# Bev Phillips wrote this story herself, deliberately in the style of the old sptékʷɬ, and says so in her
# own introduction. The audio was published with the paper. The authors note in a footnote that the
# recording and the transcription differ slightly, because a draft was used for the recording and they
# chose to edit the text and leave the recording unaltered. The two are not the same object.
