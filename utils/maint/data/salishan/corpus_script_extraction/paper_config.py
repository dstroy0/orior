# One entry per paper: who spoke it, what it is written with, and which grains its extraction has.
#
#   Usage:  from paper_config import PAPERS, marks_for, repair_for, speakers_for
#
# The alphabets and the speakers are written here and nowhere else. A second copy drifts: a paper
# added to one copy and not the other is a paper the coverage check reads with the wrong alphabet
# and reports as fully covered.
#
# WHO SPOKE IT COMES FIRST
#
# These languages belong to the people who speak them and none of this exists without them. The
# speakers are named here because naming them is a fact about the paper that a person establishes by
# reading it, the same way the alphabet is, and because a name is not something to derive from a
# column with a heuristic. Where a paper cites a published dictionary and never says who spoke, the
# entry is empty and the index says so. That is the honest answer, and the linguist does not go in
# the slot.
#
# WHAT AN ALPHABET IS FOR
#
# A token holding one of these characters is the language. Most of these papers share ʔ, ə and ɬ, and
# each entry is the shared space plus what that paper adds. A per-paper set is written as SHARED plus
# its additions and never as its own alphabet, because a checker that knows one paper's letters reads
# every other paper as empty and then reports nothing missing from it.
#
# WHAT A GRAIN IS
#
# A named kind of damage the extraction did, out of the five refs.md measures. A paper declares the
# ones it has and no others. The evidence for each declaration is the comment above it, because
# the count behind a decision is a fact about that paper.
