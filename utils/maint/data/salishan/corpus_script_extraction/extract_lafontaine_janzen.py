# Extract the nłeʔkepmxcín of wlwlmelst (Maurice Michell) from ICSNL 59, following that paper's own
# structure and its own glossing categories.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_lafontaine_janzen.py
#
# Written for one paper, and it is laid out unlike either of the other two. Each of the four stories is a
# running paragraph with no sentence numbering at all, followed by numbered interlinear blocks. The blocks
# are three lines deep and wrap. One example carries several transcription, segmentation and gloss
# lines before its translation arrives.
#
# This paper writes ł where the others write ɬ. Carrying only one of those makes every token here
# invisible to the marking and to any check built on it, and salish_marking holds both.
#
# Two parts of this paper are the language and are not transcript. Section 2 cites forms directly while
# discussing dialect, and the appendix is a full morpheme inventory with a gloss and a meaning for each
# entry. Both are kept and marked for what they are, because a token of this language that appears in the
# paper and not in the extraction is a hole, and the coverage check counts every one of them.
#
# wlwlmelst transcribed and translated these stories himself. The translations are his and are marked
# spoken. The segmentation normalizes morphemes to underlying forms and the gloss is written in category
# labels. Neither records anything uttered.
#
# These are words of wisdom passed to wlwlmelst by his mother nxwelinek and his grandmother ʔústko, and he
# shares them freely for people connecting with the language. That is recorded in the output.
