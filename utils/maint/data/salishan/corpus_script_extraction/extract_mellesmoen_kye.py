# Extract the Lushootseed of Mellesmoen and Kye, ICSNL 61, following that paper's own structure.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_mellesmoen_kye.py
#
# Written for one paper, and this one is not a narrative. It is a phonological analysis of stress in
# the two dialects of Lushootseed, and its language material arrives in five shapes: fifteen tables
# of citation forms, sixteen optimality-theoretic tableaux, six lines of Annie Jack's connected
# speech in Appendix A, thirty-odd phonotactic bullets in Appendix B, and forms cited inline with a
# gloss in quotes throughout the prose.
#
# WHICH FORMS COUNT AS A WORD HERE
#
# This is the whole difficulty of the paper and the reason a reader built on characters alone would
# poison the corpus. A tableau prints five candidate forms of one word and the analysis rejects four
# of them. An input in slashes is an abstraction the analysis posits, not a form anybody said. A
# starred form in Appendix B is there precisely because the language does not have it. Every one of
# those carries the same characters as a real word, sits in the same paragraph, and would pass any
# test built on the alphabet.
#
#   attested       Table 9 č̓ə́ƛ̓aʔ, tableau (34b) marked ☞, Appendix B č̓əƛ̓aʔ, Annie Jack's sentences
#   not attested   tableau (34a) (č̓ƛ̓áʔ) and (34c) (č̓əƛ̓áʔ), input /č̓ƛ̓aʔ/, Appendix B *c̓ƛ̓aʔ
#
# So the reader types every line by where the paper put it, and only citation, surface and utterance
# in a Lushootseed dialect reach the pure stream. The losing candidates, the inputs, the starred
# forms and the cognates from four other languages stay in the record and out of the corpus.
#
# THE DIALECTS
#
# Northern and Southern Lushootseed are printed side by side in Tables 8, 9, A1 and A2 and in
# example (18), the same gloss with a different form in each column, and the paper's whole subject
# is that the two differ. A corpus that loses the column has ǰə́šəd and ǰə́səd as two unrelated words
# of one language. The dialect comes from the table's own heading or from the tableau's own title,
# never from the shape of the form.
#
# WHAT IS CHECKED AGAINST WHAT
#
# The control is the hand extraction in build/oracles/Mellesmoen_Kye_ICSNL61.oracle.tsv, which was
# read off the paper by a person and verified against it in both directions. That file is not in
# this repository. The hand extractions are the papers' own text and are read under build/oracles.
# Nothing under maint/ holds one. This file is graded
# against it by reader_check.py. coverage_check.py separately asks the easier question, which
# is whether every token got out of the paper at all.

    ʔayʔaǰuθəm. A dialect's own name for itself arrives parenthesized after the English name of it.

    sits in. §3.2.3 discusses ɬidálgʷiɬ and q̓ílalič without naming a dialect in either sentence,
    because §3 is headed Northern Lushootseed stress pattern and the reader has been told. A passage
    naming both names them about different words, and there nothing decides.
