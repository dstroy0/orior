# Test a candidate character mapping for a paper whose font substituted plain letters for the writing.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/font_substitution.py <damaged> <clean reference> [more references]
#
# salish_purity.py sorts papers by whether the marked characters survived extraction, and it reports two
# different failures under one heading. In most of the older papers the glyphs are simply gone and the
# words arrive with holes in them. In the two Lyon papers the glyphs were replaced: the text reads
# kmúsm @s iP sncPiws smiPmáy, where @ looks like a schwa and P like a glottal stop. A substitution is
# recoverable and a deletion is not. The two need telling apart.
#
# Guessing the table is not acceptable. A mapping asserted from what the characters resemble would put
# words into a corpus that nobody said, and nothing downstream would ever question them.
#
# So the mapping is tested instead of asserted. Lyon has recent papers on the same language whose
# extraction kept its characters. Apply a candidate mapping to the damaged tokens and count how many
# become forms that appear in the clean papers. A mapping that is right turns a large share of them into
# attested words. A mapping that is wrong turns almost none, because a wrong substitution produces strings
# the language does not contain.
#
# The number to read is the change. If the hit rate before and after are both low, the reference does not
# share enough vocabulary to decide anything and the test says nothing either way.

    A marker the repository produces, such as build/, is absent from a linked worktree and a

    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree
    with no git directory, and it looks for archive/src/python, which the repository tracks and every checkout
    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
