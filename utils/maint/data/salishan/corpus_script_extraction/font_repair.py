# The font substitution the two Lyon papers need, and where each form of it may be applied.
#
#   Usage:  from font_repair import REPAIR, repaired, repaired_prose
#
# Both papers' PDFs wrote plain letters in place of the orthography. The text arrives as
# iP naPì ʼqwQaylqs where it should read iʔ naʔɬ ʼqwʕaylqs. The mapping was tested and not
# assumed: font_substitution.py applies it to the damaged tokens and counts how many become forms
# attested in Lyon's later papers on the same language. Before the mapping, 1 token of 3599 was
# attested; after it, 811. On the other paper, 2 of 4332 became 965. A wrong mapping cannot do that,
# because a wrong substitution produces strings the language does not contain.
#
# Applying it to every character of both papers was the mistake. P and Q are ordinary capitals in
# Lyon's English. The repair turned Pierre into ʔierre, Quilchena into ʕuilchena, INCEPT into
# INCEʔT and jmlyon@sfu.ca into jmlyonəsfu.ca. Those went into the record as words and were then
# reported as holes by the coverage check, which is a defect that manufactured its own evidence.
#
# There is no test on a token that separates the two. Paks, Pitx, Psiwst, Qip, Qant and Pums are
# words of the language; Pierre, Peter, Press, Priest and Quilchena are not; and every one of them
# is a capital followed by lowercase ASCII. Measured against the attested-form oracle, a rule that
# skipped that shape skipped ten real words to save eighteen English ones.
#
# What does separate them is where the token sits. These papers print their interlinear a column at
# a time, and the reader knows which column it is holding: the first two are the language and the
# rest are gloss and translation. So the repair comes in two forms. Inside a language column, and
# inside the running text of a story, every substitution applies. Everywhere else only the two that
# cannot be English apply, which leaves an all-caps gloss label and an address alone.
