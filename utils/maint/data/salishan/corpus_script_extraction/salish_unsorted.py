# The flag file every Salish extractor writes beside its output.
#
#   Usage:  from salish_unsorted import unreached, write_unsorted
#
# An extractor is written against one paper's layout and meets lines that layout does not account for.
# That happens in two ways. A line reaches the classifier and none of its tests fire, as a wrapped
# phonetic line or a form cited inline in a note does. Or a line is never reached at all, because
# it sits in front matter, in an appendix, or in a section the extractor was not told to read.
#
# Neither is a line to guess about and neither is a line to drop. The rule is the same for both: flag it,
# name why, and hold it out of the ingestion stream until a person has said what it is. A guess costs more
# than a gap, because a gap is visible and a wrong guess is not.
#
# The second kind is found by comparing instead of by parsing. Every token in the source carrying a
# character the language is written with should appear somewhere in the extraction. A source line
# holding words that no extracted row holds was not reached. That is the same test coverage_check.py runs,
# and the number it reports does not change: these lines are flagged instead of classified. They still count
# against coverage. What changes is that the gap now has a file naming every line in it.
#
# A paper whose extractor repairs its source has to be compared after the same repair. Comparing a repaired
# extraction against an unrepaired source reports every correctly repaired word as unreached. The repair
# is passed in and applied to the source line first.
