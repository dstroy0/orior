# Extract the Lushootseed of Vi taqʷšəblu Hilbert from ICSNL 1983, following that paper's own
# structure.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_hilbert.py
#
# Written for one paper. Poking Fun in Lushootseed is her essay, in English, about humor her
# students kept missing, with forty numbered examples in Lushootseed set into it. Each example is
# printed twice under the same number: the Lushootseed first, then her English for it. So the
# number is the pairing and the order decides which is which. Nothing else has to.
#
# THE ORTHOGRAPHY IS NOT REPAIRED.
#
# This is a 1983 typescript and its scan is badly damaged. ʔ arrives as ?, ə arrives as ~ and J and
# G, ʷ arrives as V and v, and her own name is set as VI [!.aq liS'"} blu] lIil bert. The Lyon
# papers had damage like this and it was repaired, but only because a candidate table could be
# tested: applying it moved attested tokens from 1 of 3599 to 811 against Lyon's later papers on the
# same language.
#
# The same test on this paper says nothing. Six modern Lushootseed papers yield 1068 distinct
# Lushootseed tokens between them, and of the 103 damaged tokens here, 0 are attested before a
# candidate mapping and 0 after. Her vocabulary is Raven and Bear and Marblemount and the names of
# houses; theirs is grammar. The reference does not share enough with her to decide anything, the
# case font_substitution.py names as the test having said nothing either way.
#
# So the text comes out as it arrived. A guessed table applied to Vi Hilbert's words would put forms
# into a corpus that nobody said, and nothing downstream would ever question them. Marked damaged
# and left alone, the words are still hers, and the repair stays available to whoever finds a
# reference that shares her vocabulary.
#
# WHERE HER ENGLISH ENDS, WHICH THIS FILE GETS RIGHT NINETEEN TIMES IN TWENTY-ONE
#
# The typescript sets each example in an indented column and the essay at full width, and the
# extraction dropped every leading space. The width survived and separates the two, and COLUMN
# below reads it. What it does not separate is an example's English from a story summary
# printed under it, because those are set in the same indented column and the blank line between
# them is gone too.
#
# The proportion rule catches eight of the ten that run on: her English for an example is about as
# long as the example, never more than one line longer. Examples 15 and 18 run on by exactly one
# line and pass it. Both are recorded correctly in the hand extraction, the control this file is
# graded against, and neither reaches the pure stream, since only the Lushootseed does.
#
# She asks in the paper that the moral of a story never be explained. That is not this file's to
# keep or break. It is the reason her essay is kept whole beside the examples and not thrown away
# as apparatus. The essay is where she says what she is doing and why.
