# Extract the St'át'imcets of Qwa7yán'ak (Carl Alexander) from ICSNL 61, following that paper's own
# structure and its own glossing conventions.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_alexander_davis.py
#
# Written for one paper. Section 1.3 states the format: section 2 is the story in St'át'imcets only,
# section 3 is an English translation, section 4 is the fully analyzed text with a timestamp about every
# two minutes, and two appendices hold an orthography chart and the glossing abbreviations. Henry Davis
# divided the story into three parts and the part headings are his.
#
# Two of the conventions decide what may enter a corpus of spoken language, and the paper is explicit
# about both.
#
# Square brackets hold material Davis inserted: grammatically necessary and elided in fast or casual
# speech, or supplied where there was a speech error. That is his and it is derived.
#
# Round brackets hold extraneous material, which he lists as false starts and repetitions. That is
# Qwa7yán'ak speaking. A false start is speech. It stays.
#
# Curly brackets mark material missing by regular phonological rule and appear in section 4 only.
#
# The orthography is van Eijk's, converting one to one into NAPA, and writes the glottal stop as 7. A
# marking set built on the marked consonants alone finds almost nothing here.
#
# Recorded by Henry Davis at Qwa7yán'ak's home at Nxwísten (Bridge River) on 7 July 2025. The recording
# runs just over half an hour and is published with the paper. Davis transcribed, translated and analyzed
# it and wrote the introduction.
