# Check that every token of the language in a paper reached the file extracted from it.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/coverage_check.py
#
# A per-paper extractor is written against one paper's layout and can miss a section without saying so.
# Story 3 of the Garcia narratives was numbered differently from stories 1 and 2 and came back empty.
# Section 4 of the Matthewson paper fell from thirty-four blocks to two because a footnote marker matched
# a heading. The Alexander story sits in subsections and reading the bare numbers returned two appendices
# and none of the narrative. Every one of those was silent.
#
# The check that catches them is a diff. Every token in the source carrying a character of the language
# should appear somewhere in the extraction, and the number that do not should be zero.
#
# Both sides have to be put through the same transformation first, which the first version of this file
# did not do. Some extractors repair the source before writing it: the space the PDF inserted after each
# combining mark is closed, and two papers had a font that wrote plain letters in place of the
# orthography. Comparing a repaired extraction against an unrepaired source reports every correctly
# repaired word as missing, and that produced 173 false holes in one paper. So the repairs are
# applied to the source lines here before either side is tokenized, and it does not matter that a repair
# is lossy as long as both sides receive it.
#
# What this reports that is not an error: a token is counted as covered if it appears anywhere in the
# extraction. A form living only in a footnote is found wherever the extractor kept it. What it reports
# that is an error: a form cited in prose that no section captures, an appendix nobody read, and a
# sentence a splitter dropped.
