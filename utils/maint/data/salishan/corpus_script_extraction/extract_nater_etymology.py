# Extract the Bella Coola etymological database Hank Nater published in 2013.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_nater_etymology.py
#
# 1407 numbered lines over 52 pages, which is more of one language than the rest of this set holds
# together. Nater is asking how Salish Bella Coola is, and his answer is a table: every morpheme he
# knows, sorted by where it came from. 209 proto-Salish, 94 Coastal, 63 Interior, 214 non-Salish, 34
# areal, and 661 he cannot place at all.
#
# TWO TABLES, NOT ONE
#
# Sections 2.2 and 2.3 print four columns: line, gloss, the Bella Coola form, and a cognate in some
# other language. Section 4 prints two: the Na90 practical orthography with its gloss, then the
# phonemic form. The two need separate readers because their columns divide on different evidence.
# A reader that took the last form on every line would take the Bella Coola word through section 4
# and somebody else's language through everything before it.
#
# WHAT IS NOT BELLA COOLA
#
# The cognate column is the point of the paper and it is where the other languages are. Section 2.3.4
# carries 121 entries of Haisla, Heiltsuk, Oowekyala and Kwak̓wala, which are North Wakashan, and
# section 2.3.4's second table adds Proto-Athabascan, Eyak, Carrier, Tahltan, Nootka, Quileute,
# Chinook and Yurok. Squamish, Sechelt, Shuswap, Lillooet and Halkomelem are Salish and still not
# this language. The who column says which, and only the Bella Coola column reaches the pure stream.
#
# The cognate column is found by its opening token, which is one of the abbreviations the paper
# defines for itself in section 1.1, a defined language name, or a reconstruction opening with an
# asterisk. All three are the paper's own notation. No rule here was invented for the purpose.
#
# THE PRACTICAL ORTHOGRAPHY IS THE SAME WORDS IN DIFFERENT LETTERS
#
# Section 4 prints each entry twice. AKW'A and ʔak‟ʷa are one word, and section 2.1 gives the
# mapping: ʷ is written w, c is ts, ƛ‟ is tl‟, ɬ is lh, x is c, χ is x, and ʔ is 7. Both are Bella
# Coola. Both are recorded, but only the phonemic column joins the pure stream. Two orthographies
# in one stream would put the byte pairs of a transliteration into the measurement of a language.
