# Extract the St'át'imcets of K̓weswapáw̓ / Linda Redan from ICSNL 61, following that paper's own structure
# and its own glossing categories.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_matthewson_redan.py
#
# Written for one paper, and this one is a different language from the three before it and a different
# orthography again. St'át'imcets writes the glottal stop as the digit 7. Cw7aoz, skúza7 and ts7ásas
# carry none of the marked characters the other papers use. A test built on those marks alone finds almost
# nothing here, and the marking set is passed in per paper for that reason.
#
# Four things about this paper decide how it is read.
#
# The square brackets in section 2 hold Lisa Matthewson's notes on Linda's laughter and gestures, and they
# are written in St'át'imcets. So they are the target language and they are not Linda speaking. They are
# marked derived. The same notes in section 3 are in English.
#
# Linda moves into English inside her own narrative and the paper glosses that as part of the utterance,
# and her closing lines are entirely English. Those lines are hers and are kept whole.
#
# Section 5 discusses indefinite pronouns and repeats lines from the story, and one of its examples is not
# Linda's at all: example 35 is from Sam Mitchell, published in Van Eijk and Williams 1981. That is marked
# with its own speaker so the attribution does not blur.
#
# Lisa transcribed, translated and glossed the story and checked the transcription and translation with
# Linda. The story was told over Zoom on October 31, 2025 and runs three minutes and twenty-eight seconds.
