# Extract the nɬeʔkepmxcín of Kʷəɬtəzétkʷu (Bernice Garcia) from ICSNL 59, following that paper's own
# structure and its own glossing categories.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_garcia.py
#
# Written for one paper. Reading the whole paper first is what this file is an argument for: stories 1 and
# 2 number their parts X.1 preamble, X.2 nɬeʔkepmxcín, X.3 English, X.4 gloss, and story 3 has no preamble
# subsection. It runs 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 instead. A rule that assumed X.4 returned nothing for story 3 and
# reported no error. A third of a paper left that way without anyone noticing.
#
# Kʷəɬtəzétkʷu moves between her languages inside her own telling, in the introduction and again inside
# stories 2 and 3, and the paper glosses those English words as part of the sentence. A line she mixed is
# kept whole and its spans are marked in place, because splitting it means deciding for each word which
# language it belongs to, and us, te and kn are words in both.
#
# The gloss categories are the paper's own, taken from its footnote 1 and used unchanged. Renaming them
# would make this file disagree with the source it came from.
#
# Two files come out. One holds everything found, marked. Nothing is lost and a reader can check it
# against the paper. The other holds only what she said in the target language, with no gloss, no
# segmentation, no translation and no marks. That file is what gets ingested.
#
# Bernice Garcia asked that it be acknowledged that she is a Kamloops Indian Residential School speaker
# who is re-learning her language. That is recorded in the output because she asked for it.
