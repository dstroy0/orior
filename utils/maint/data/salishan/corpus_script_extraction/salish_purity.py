# Find out which extracted papers kept the writing and which quietly lost it, for Section 4.13 of
# theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/salish_purity.py
#
# Van Eijk lists the Lillooet resonants and the extraction returned "m   n   l   ḷ   γ   ʕ   ʕw w   y  z",
# where every gap held a glottalized consonant that is now gone. Those are phonemes. Two words that differ
# only in glottalization are one word after that loss, and every count taken on the file is a count on a
# language with a smaller inventory than Lillooet has. Robertson's paper in the same volume came through
# with ɬəw̓ál̓məš whole, combining marks and all. This is a property of the file and not of the family.
#
# The gate in corpus_gate.py cannot catch it. What is left after the loss is still writing, still in the script
# it claims, and still passes at any floor. The check has to look for what should be there instead of what
# should not, which means naming the characters a Salish orthography cannot do without and counting them.
#
# Two things are counted. The presence of the inventory, since a page of Salish with no glottal stop and
# no schwa in it did not extract. And the gaps themselves, since a dropped glyph leaves its space behind
# and a damaged line reads as letters separated by runs of blanks.
#
# Nothing here decides that a paper is usable. It sorts the papers so that the ones worth copying by hand
# are known before the copying starts, and so that a paper that has to be read off the page visually is
# known to need that.

    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree
    with no git directory, and it looks for src/python, which the repository tracks and every checkout
    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
