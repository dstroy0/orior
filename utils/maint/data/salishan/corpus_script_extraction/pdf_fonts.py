# Find out which fonts a PDF uses and whether each one carries a map back to Unicode.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/pdf_fonts.py <name> [name ...]
#
# salish_purity.py reports which extracted papers lost their phonemes, and the answer for everything
# published before about 2014 is all of them. Lushootseed with neither glottal stop, schwa nor lateral
# fricative is not Lushootseed, and the whole pre-2010 literature in this archive reads that way.
#
# The glyphs are still in those files. The map from the font's own character codes back
# to Unicode is missing, the ToUnicode entry a PDF may or may not carry. Where it is absent the extractor
# gets a code and has nothing to turn it into. It emits whatever the code happens to mean in a default
# encoding and the marked consonants come out as blanks.
#
# This reports, for each font in a file, whether that map is present. A font with a map that still
# extracts badly is a different problem from a font with no map at all, and the second one is recoverable
# by supplying the table the font was designed against.
