# Find formatting damage by matching case-sensitively against a corpus known to be right.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/case_delta.py
#
# Case carries meaning. Essen capitalized mid-sentence is not essen, and none of these orthographies
# capitalizes at random either: a capital in the middle of a word is labialization in one paper's
# convention, a glottal stop in another's damaged font, and a sentence boundary in neither.
#
# So match twice. A token that the pure corpus holds exactly is right. A token the pure corpus holds
# only once case is folded away is the same word written wrong, and the difference between the two
# counts is the formatting damage in a paper, measured and not guessed at.
#
# This needs the oracle to be true, and it runs against the .pure.txt files instead of the papers.
# Those came out of nine readers written line by line against nine layouts.

    A marker the repository produces, such as build/, is absent from a linked worktree and a
    never-built clone, and a climb to it can pass this root and land in another checkout whose paths
    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree
    with no git directory, and it looks for archive/src/python, which the repository tracks and every checkout
    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
    returning the current directory instead of the root.
