# Extract the Twana augmentative reduplications Hyung-Soo Kim reanalyzes in ICSNL 52.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_kim_twana.py
#
# The first Twana paper in this set, and Twana has no anchor yet. Every Twana form here is
# Drachman's, from a 1969 dissertation Kim calls the only reliable reference in existence for this.
# The paper prints close to everything written down.
#
# THE FIRST EXAMPLE IS NOT TWANA
#
# Example (1) sits where the data usually starts and it is Tillamook, in Edel's 1939 transcription,
# with its own vowel letters A, E, U and its own stress mark. Examples (19) and (20) are Thompson
# and Lillooet, and footnote 9 carries Puget Sound Salish, Moses-Columbian and a row of English
# phonetics. A reader that took every numbered example as Twana would seed a Twana corpus with five
# other languages and some English.
#
# WHAT IS NOT A WORD
#
# The derivations are the bulk of the paper and their intermediate lines are underlying forms
# nobody said: *soq̓ʷ-sóq̓ʷay, ʔas-bx̦-báx̦. The paper marks them with an asterisk where it cites one
# and with the cent sign where the form is wrong outright. Both are held out of the pure stream.

    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree

    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
