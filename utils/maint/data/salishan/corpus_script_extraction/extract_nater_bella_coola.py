# Extract the Nuxalk of Dr. Margaret Siwallace from ICSNL 50, following that paper's own structure and its
# own symbols.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_nater_bella_coola.py
#
# Written for one paper. This is the simplest layout of the set: an introduction, a section defining the
# symbols, the text itself as numbered blocks, and references. Each block gives the Nuxalk with its
# morpheme markers, a gloss under it, and an English translation. A long sentence wraps. One block can
# carry several transcription and gloss pairs before the translation arrives.
#
# Nater defines his own symbols in section 2 and they are used unchanged here. The character ˽, which he
# names Combining Inverted Bridge Below, follows proclitics and precedes enclitics. A hyphen follows a
# prefix and precedes a suffix. A colon precedes a reduplicated consonant. Those three carry the
# morphology and are part of the text, not punctuation to be stripped.
#
# The story is The Frog Children, told by the late Dr. Margaret Siwallace and recorded over forty years
# before the paper was published in 2015. Nater notes that the narrator first calls it a sʔalac'i, a
# family-owned account, and then uses smsmayamk, to tell as a parable. It sits between the two genres
# the language names.

    of it holds.
