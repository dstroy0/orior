# The T and N marking convention shared by every per-paper Salish extractor.
#
#   Usage:  from salish_marking import rendered, tagged_spans, is_mixed
#
# Every paper is read by its own extractor, because the papers are laid out differently and one rule
# across all of them takes whichever layout it was written for and mangles the rest without reporting it.
# What the extractors do share is how a line is marked once it has been found, and that lives here so the
# convention cannot drift between files.
#
# T is the target language. N is anything else. A line is never cut into separate rows: a speaker who
# moves between her languages inside one sentence said one sentence. The spans are marked in place and
# in order and the line keeps its identity. That also leaves the switches grouped by line and sortable,
# which is where the boundaries of the morphological system show.
#
# Two English-looking tokens in a row are required to open an N span. Several clitics of these languages
# are written in plain letters, and a single plain token is as likely to be one of those as it is to be
# English. Leaving a word inside T is the harmless direction to be wrong in, and a word wrongly pulled out
# of her sentence is not.

# The marked characters these orthographies are written with. A token holding any of them is the
# language. Both ɬ and ł are here: papers differ on which they use for the lateral fricative, and
# LaFontaine and Janzen write ł throughout where Hall and Phillips write ɬ. Carrying only one makes
# every token of the other paper invisible to the marking and to any coverage check built on it.

# A run of two or more capitals is a gloss label or an acronym in the papers that use this:
# APPL, INCEPT, 1SG.POSS, D/C, NMLZ. Finding one in a line that should hold a word is how a reader
# tells that it has lost its place in a block.
#
# USE IT INSIDE A READER THAT KNOWS ITS OWN PAPER, NEVER CORPUS WIDE. Some of these
# orthographies do write a word that way. Nater writes his roots and his
# headwords in capitals, which is his convention and not a label: √ALATS', ALH7ALHTSIM, S7AYK'S.
# Kim writes reduplication templates the same way, CVC-CV́C and C1VC2-C1V́C2X.
#
# Measured over every oracle, counting only tokens that already pass is_language_token under their
# own paper's marks: applying this test corpus wide would strike 311 distinct tokens the hand
# extractions hold, 151 of them in 2013_Nater and 152 in 22-Nater-Bella-Coola-tale-10, which is
# most of what those two papers carry. It would do it silently. The four readers that use it today
# each apply it inside one paper they were written for, and it is safe where it stands for that.

# What the three above do not carry: ̓ ̔ ̕ are the glottalization marks a paper stacks on a
# consonant, ʷ is labialization, and ˽ is the raised space Nater sets a clitic boundary with.
#
# Two files had their own copy of this union defined, salish_unsorted and hand_extraction's
# papers, and MARKED was the default wherever a caller passed nothing. Both are read from here now.
# A per-paper set is written as this plus what that paper adds, never as its own alphabet.
#
# THIS SET CARRIES NO PHONETIC CONTENT. ɬ and ł are both members because both occur, and nothing
# here says the two are one sound. A distribution taken over these characters is a distribution over
# what a transcriber typed. The table that takes a written form and returns the sound it stands for
# is build/experiments/salish_phonemes.py. The Salishan research paper's chapter on going from the page to a
# distribution over sounds names the three stages, character, segment and sound, and says which tool
# belongs to each and what a measurement reads if a stage is skipped.
