# Extract the Nsyilxcn inchoatives John Lyon surveys in ICSNL 60.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_lyon_inchoatives.py
#
# Elicited from ɬk̓mxnalqs Delphine Derrickson-Armstrong and c̓əskʕáknaʔ Dave Michele of Westbank
# reserve. The data is two tables of 48 roots, each row giving the root, its positive adjective, and
# what it does with each of the three inchoative markers, plus a corpus survey citing cognates from
# six other Salish languages.
#
# A STAR IS NOT A WORD
#
# Most cells of both tables are starred: *piq-p, *x̌aq̓-t, *ʔilxʷ•əxʷ. A starred form is one the
# linguist built and the speakers rejected, and nobody has ever said one. Putting them in a pure
# corpus would seed it with words the language does not have, which is worse than leaving them out,
# because the whole point of the corpus is to say what the language looks like. They are kept in the
# record marked "impossible" and held out of the pure stream. The same goes for the marginal forms
# the paper marks with a question mark.
#
# WHAT IS NOT NSYILXCN
#
# Section 4 cites cognates from Spokane, Secwepemctsín, Lillooet, nxaʔamxčín, Thompson and Coeur
# d'Alene, each behind a two-letter tag. Those are Salish and they are not Nsyilxcn. The who
# column carries the language and the pure stream takes the Nsyilxcn alone.
