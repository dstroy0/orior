# The three repairs the Mellesmoen and Kye extraction needs.
#
#   Usage:  from mellesmoen_kye_repair import repaired
#
# Held in one file because three things apply them: the reader, the hand extraction check, and the
# coverage check. Two copies of a repair drift, and the check then reports as a hole every word one
# copy put together and the other did not.
#
# THE INSERTED SPACE
#
# The PDF sets a stacked diacritic by leaving room after it, and the extraction reads that room as a
# space. c̓ íx̌ id is the single word c̓íx̌id, x̌ ə́ k̓ ʷəd is x̌ə́k̓ʷəd, and there are 186 lines of it.
#
# ʷ is left out of the joining set. It is a spacing modifier letter on the baseline, and the PDF
# never has to make room after one. Every space following a ʷ in this paper is a real word boundary:
# bəlkʷ ‘return’, wix̌ʷ x̌il, sčədadxʷ sʔuladxʷ, tíləxʷ ʔəsxʷák̓ʷilbids. Including it welded thirteen
# pairs of words, among them the first two words of Annie Jack's opening sentence.
#
# The extraction prints two spaces where a real boundary follows a stacked mark. That keeps
# the two columns of Table A1 apart at č̓ ə́šay̓  č̓ əsáy̓. Only a lone space gets closed.
#
# One join is wrong and is known to be. Line 1349 cites the palatal series in prose as /ǰ č č̓  š/.
# ǰ ends in a caron with one space after it, exactly as a broken word does, and it comes out /ǰč
# č̓ š/. Nothing in either line separates that case from c̓ əq̓ c ‘spear’, the single word c̓əq̓c.
# The reader flags ǰč instead of pretending the repair got it. It costs a prose line and no word of
# the language: ǰ, č, č̓ and š are each in the corpus from other lines.
#
# THE EJECTIVE WRITTEN TWO WAYS
#
# The body writes the ejective with COMBINING COMMA ABOVE and the appendices write it with COMBINING
# COMMA ABOVE RIGHT. č̓ƛ̓aʔ ‘rock’ is printed four times with the first mark and once, in Appendix B,
# with the second. One paper prints one word both ways, and that makes the second mark the same mark.
# The same holds for l̓: the body writes c̓əbə́l̓qid with COMBINING COMMA ABOVE and Appendix B writes
# x̌ʷul̕-b with COMBINING COMMA ABOVE RIGHT.
#
# Eight tokens carry the second mark, all of them in the two appendices. Left alone, ƛ̓ and ƛ̕ are two
# different letters to everything downstream, and the corpus holds Annie Jack's ƛ̕u= apart from the
# ƛ̓ of every other paper.
#
# EVERY ACCENTED VOWEL WRITTEN TWO WAYS
#
# The paper writes á as one character in some places and as a with a combining acute in others, and
# the same for í, à and ù. It writes ǰ as j with a combining caron throughout. Both forms of á render
# identically and no reading of the paper finds the difference. The hand extraction did not find it:
# thirteen of its rows were reported as forms the paper does not hold until this ran.
#
# c̓ágʷačiʔb ‘wash hands’ is the case to look at. Table 7 prints it one way and the prose about
# Figure 3 prints it the other. One word of one paper is then two words to anything comparing
# strings, and a corpus built without this holds both of them.
#
# NFC fixes it, and it is the only repair here that is not a judgment about this paper. Unicode
# defines canonical equivalence: a with a combining acute and á are the same character under that
# definition, and NFC is its composed form. Nothing else moves. There is no precomposed schwa with
# an acute, no x with a caron and no k with a comma above. Ə́, x̌ and k̓ come through untouched.
