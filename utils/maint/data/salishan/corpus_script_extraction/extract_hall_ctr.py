# Extract the nɬeʔkepmxcín transitive forms Hall, Luntzlara, Mellesmoen and Reid cite in ICSNL 61.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/corpus_script_extraction/extract_hall_ctr.py
#
# Every form in this paper is printed twice and only one of the two was ever said. The paper sets a
# surface form in square brackets and the underlying form it proposes for it in slashes, side by
# side, all the way through: [wéc̓entis] beside /wéc̓e-n-t-ey-es/, [kíc.ne] beside /kíc-n-t-∅-ene/.
#
# THE DELIMITER IS THE EVIDENCE
#
# That makes the reader's job the paper's own notation. A run inside square brackets is a word;
# a run inside slashes is the authors' analysis of it and holds morpheme boundaries, a null
# morpheme sign and an occasional subscript. Only the bracketed forms reach the pure stream, the
# same rule that holds Kim's underlying forms and Wolfe's reconstructions out of theirs.
#
# A star marks a form the analysis predicts and the language does not have. The paper writes it two
# ways, *[kícetxʷ] and [*kícexʷ]. Both are tested for.
#
# WHAT THE DERIVATION TABLES HOLD
#
# Examples (24) and (29) to (31) are ordered-rule derivations, and every line between the underlying
# form and the surface form is a stage: kícntene, kícntne, kícnne, kícne. Those carry no delimiter at
# all, because the paper sets them in a column instead. This reader does not try to find them. They
# go out unclassified, which for a form nobody said is the safe direction to be wrong in.
#
# The same is true of the surface forms the prose prints bare, kicnəxʷ and wíktxʷ among them. The
# hand extraction has all of them. This reader misses them, because the alternative is guessing at a
# bare token, and a wrong guess puts a form in the corpus that nobody said.
#
# NOT THIS LANGUAGE
#
# Section 3.1.1 argues from two other languages. ʔayʔaǰuθəm has -θi and St'át'imcets has -ci, and the
# paper's point is that neither can hold an underlying /s/. Newman's proto-Salish *c and *ci are in
# there too. The who column carries all of them. None reaches a nɬeʔkepmxcín corpus.
