# Make every hand extraction a tab-separated file a linter accepts.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/hand_extraction/tsv_tidy.py
#
# Two things fail csvlint and both were in every oracle file.
#
# The explanation of what the file is opened it, thirty-five to forty lines of it behind a hash.
# There is no comment syntax in a tab-separated file, and a linter reads the first line as the
# header. That prose is worth keeping. It moves to a .oracle.md beside the table.
#
# The rows were ragged. A row with no gloss stopped after four fields where the header names five,
# and a linter counts that as a short row on every one of them. Each row is padded to the header's
# width with empty fields.
#
# A tab or a newline inside a field would do the same damage from the other direction. Both come
# out here as they do in the flag files.

    A marker the repository produces, such as build/, is absent from a linked worktree and a
    never-built clone, and a climb to it can pass this root and land in another checkout whose paths
    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree
    with no git directory, and it looks for src/python, which the repository tracks and every checkout
    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
    returning the current directory instead of the root.
