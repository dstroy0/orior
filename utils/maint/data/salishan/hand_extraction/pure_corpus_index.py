# Write the README that opens the hand extractions, speaker first, from the config and the tables.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/data/salishan/hand_extraction/pure_corpus_index.py
#
# The list of who is in this corpus was kept by hand in refs.md and in the tables both, and two copies
# of a list drift. The names come from paper_config.py and the row counts from the tables. Neither
# is typed twice and refs.md points here instead of restating it.
#
# WHO GETS THE CREDIT
#
# The speaker. Every one of these languages belongs to the people who speak it and none of this work
# exists without them. The corpus everything else is measured against is their words written down.
#
# The names are read from the config and not derived from the who column. That column does several
# jobs across twenty tables, and a first version of this file guessed at it and put linguists in the
# speaker slot on eleven of them. Whose language a paper holds is a fact a person establishes by
# reading the paper, the same way its alphabet is. It is declared and not inferred. Where a paper
# cites a published dictionary and never says who spoke, the entry is empty and this prints that.

    """This repository, asked of git and not inferred from a marker directory.

    The marker climbed to before was build/, which the repository PRODUCES and not CONTAINS.
    A linked worktree and a never-built clone both lack it. The climb then walked past the root it
    was looking for into another checkout entirely, and every path derived from it pointed at a
    different tree than the tool was run from. That lands on a real repository with real files,
    which is indistinguishable from working.

    A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below is kept only for an exported tree with
    no git directory, and it looks for src/python, which is TRACKED: a marker the repository
    contains is present in every checkout of it, and a marker the repository produces is present in
    none of them until something has already run.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
    returning the current directory instead of the root.
