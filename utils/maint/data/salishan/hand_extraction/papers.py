# Which hand extraction goes with which paper and which record.
#
#   Usage:  from papers import EVERY
#
# One table, read by both checks. Two copies of it drift, and then the check that grades a reader
# against a hand extraction is grading it against a different paper than the check that grades the
# hand extraction against its source.
#
# Both checks read corpus_script_extraction/paper_config.py, the only file where a paper is
# described: who spoke it, what it is written with, and which grains its extraction carries.
#
# What stays here is the shape the two checks want, and the one fact that belongs to the checks and
# not to the papers: which extractions are not what their page says.

# Papers whose text extraction is not what the page says. Both are TeX Type1 with a custom encoding
# and no ToUnicode map, and pypdf and pypdfium2 lose the same things: the page prints cítxʷsəlx uɬ ti
# nyʕip and the text holds cítxws@lx uì ’ti ny ’Qip, with the ejective mark landing in front of its
# letter instead of over it.
#
# draft_page_text.py writes build/papers/<stem>.page.txt for these, line for line with the
# extraction, and the checks read that instead. Every rule it applies came off a rendered page, but
# one of them guesses: page kʷ and page wist both arrive as w, and the draft labializes a w after the
# consonants that take it. Until a person has read the pages, .page.txt is a draft and these two
# papers are still listed here.

PAGE_TEXT = "%s.page.txt"

# Papers whose extraction holds none of the orthography and which have no drafted page text either.
# These are OCR of typed pages, not a font encoding. There is no mapping to invert: the scan lost
# the marks and nothing in the file records what they were.
#
# Counted over the nine marks the corpus uses, in every registered paper's text. These five hold
# zero schwa, zero barred l, zero barred lambda, zero c and s with caron, zero raised w, zero comma
# above, zero caron and zero dot below. 1975_Hilbert_Hess writes taqWsablu where the page prints
# taqʷšəblu, and 1967_Hess writes "The Lorph I-(e)bl in Snohomish" for "The Morph /-(ə)b/ in
# Snohomish". 1967_Elmendorf loses the English too, printing TES'l'S OF A HYPOfBESIS and dating
# itself 1961, and its scan is bad enough that 196 of its tokens pass is_language_token and every
# one is debris: 'l'wana, '!'wana, 'rWana and six other shapes for Twana, plus 'paralle1 and 'exicon.
# They pass because the apostrophes and digits the scan injects are characters this corpus's marks
# set holds as orthography. That number is the largest in the tree by an order of magnitude and it
# is not a gap in the reading, which is worth stating because it reads like one.
# 1967_Kinkade holds no glottal stop either, in 19653 characters: its line 54 reads
# nlafWalqWpcxWta? ?aci~ftcin where the page prints nləʕʷálqʷpcxʷtaʔ ʔacíx̣x̌cín, and it gives the
# horse word as ~a~c{n for x̣x̌cín.
#
# All four papers of ICSNL 2 read here are in this state, which is a fact about the 1967 typescripts
# and not about any one of them. Registering 1967_Hamp without this entry put 338 disagreements into
# the tree in one step, every one of them the scan and none of them the reader.
#
# 19-Lyon_ICSNL50_final-78 and 2013_Lindley_Lyon count zero on the same nine and are not here,
# because draft_page_text.py can put their orthography back from the font encoding. 1983_Hilbert
# counts zero as well and is not here either: its text encodes the orthography another way, its
# entry declares that alphabet as DAMAGED, and its hand extraction was written to match.
#
# A hand extraction of one of these cannot be checked against its paper's text, because that text is
# not the paper. Reporting the difference as disagreements grades a correct reading against a file
# the reading is right to differ from. The check states the condition instead and counts nothing.
# What would settle them is a page text transcribed from the scan, the way the two Lyon papers have
# one generated.
