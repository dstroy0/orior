# Check a hand extraction against the paper it was read off.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/hand_extraction/oracle_check.py
#
# The hand extraction is the control every reader is graded against, which puts the whole weight of
# the corpus on it being right. A person reading a thirty-seven page paper into a table skips rows
# and mistypes marks, and neither shows up later as anything but a corpus that quietly disagrees
# with the paper.
#
# So the table is checked against the paper both ways. Every form written down has to be findable in
# the source, which catches a mistyped mark and an invented row. Every word in the source has to
# appear in some form written down, which catches a skipped row and a table read only halfway. The
# second direction finds omissions, and omissions are what a person reading by hand
# actually produces.
#
# Both sides go through the paper's repairs first, for the reason coverage_check.py states: comparing
# a repaired hand extraction against an unrepaired source reports every correctly repaired word as
# missing.
