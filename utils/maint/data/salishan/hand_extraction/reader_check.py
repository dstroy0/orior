# Grade a reader against the hand extraction it is supposed to reproduce.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/hand_extraction/reader_check.py
#
# coverage_check.py asks whether every token of the language got out of the paper. That is the
# easier question and a reader can answer it perfectly while being wrong about everything that
# matters: it can file a rejected tableau candidate as a word, put a Squamish cognate in a
# Lushootseed corpus, or read Table 8's two columns as one dialect. Every token would still be
# accounted for.
#
# This asks the harder question. The hand extraction says what each form is. The reader is graded
# against it form by form, on three things: whether it found the form at all, whether it says the
# same kind, and whether it says the same dialect.
#
# The one it must not fail is kind, because kind decides the pure corpus. A candidate filed as a
# citation puts a form the paper rejects into the corpus, and nothing downstream ever asks again.
