# Turn the TeX font's encoding back into the orthography, as far as it goes.
#
#   Usage:  from lyon_encoding import drafted
#
# 19-Lyon_ICSNL50_final-78 and 2013_Lindley_Lyon are set in NimbusRomNo9L and TeX-xipa with a custom
# encoding and no ToUnicode map. What pypdf hands back is glyph codes read as ASCII. Page 1 of
# Lindley prints q̓sápi ɬaʔ ct̓ʕapənwíxʷ and the text holds ’qsápi ìaP c’tQap@nwíxw.
#
# WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
#
# It is a draft. Every rule below was read off a rendered page and holds on the pages checked, and
# the output still has to be verified against the page before it counts as the paper. It exists
# because retyping 148 pages by hand introduces its own errors, and a draft a person corrects is
# more accurate than a page a person types from nothing.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT DO
#
# w is two letters. Page kʷukʷ and page wist both arrive as w, and nothing in the text separates
# them. The rule below labializes a w that follows one of the consonants that take it, which is
# right for kʷ, qʷ, xʷ, x̌ʷ and wrong wherever a real w follows a consonant.
#
# Word boundaries are the other one. The PDF puts a space in front of a letter carrying a mark.
# s ’plá ’ks@lx is one word, iP ’kl is two, and both of them are a space in front of a marked
# letter. Page 25 settles the first as sp̓lák̓səlx and page 24 the second as iʔ k̓l. `wa’y` and `Lyon’s`
# are the same case with the space missing instead of inserted.
#
# Those are the sites to read first on any page, and they are why this file is not a repair in
# papers.py: a repair is applied and trusted, and this has to be checked.

    Token by token, because a line is mixed. One gloss line reads COMP DET native.person and the

    The wedge goes first and over the whole line: ˇx is x̌ in the Salish and appears nowhere else,
    and it is what a token needs to look Salish to the test that follows.

    The length mark goes over the whole line too, and for the same reason: lengthened() has to see
    across the inserted space to tell qw@mí;; ’wt from níkmən; iP.

    LETTERS runs on a Salish token only. Its codes are ordinary characters elsewhere, and ; was the
    one that showed it: Lyon ends a clause with a semicolon in his English, and mapping the line
    without asking turned long ago over there; we came into over there· we came.

    labialized runs over the whole joined line, and that is a known defect, and its cost is measured on
    both sides. Running it line-wide reads the w of an English gloss as a labializing one wherever
    a k or a q or an x stands in front of it. Backwards is drafted backʷards and
    he.fell.off.backwards is drafted he.fell.off.backʷards, and the check then reports the hand
    extraction as disagreeing with the paper over a word of English.

    Gating it on salish() instead is worse and was measured: the drafted ʷ count falls from 1624 to
    1172 on 19-Lyon and from 1729 to 1017 on Lindley, and the tree goes from 214 disagreements to
    827. salish() asks for a mark of the orthography or a medial P, and kwukw carries neither.
    The tokens that most need labializing are exactly the ones that gate turns off.

    a_gloss() does not separate them either: it wants a run of two capitals, and backwards has
    none. What actually distinguishes them is the line, not the token, since the five-line
    interlinear puts glosses on a line of their own. Deciding that is a change to what this draft
    says a page reads. It waits on the pages and not on a heuristic.
