# Some of these PDFs drop a combining mark and leave behind the space the typesetter made room for.
# Davis and Mellesmoen prints xʷəlp-í<p>l̓əx once with the mark and once as xʷəlp-í<p>l əx without it.
# One word arrives two ways in one file and nothing in either marks which is right.
#
# Reading it off a rendered page works and does not scale. Twenty papers at twenty-four pages each is
# a person squinting at four hundred images, and every one of those readings is a judgment nobody can
# check afterward. This asks the algorithm instead, and the answer comes with a number on it.
#
# THE METHOD IS THE SAME ONE boundary_check USES
#
# A break site is a place where the extraction has two tokens and the paper may have had one. The
# candidates are the two tokens joined by each mark the paper writes, and joined by nothing,
# the reading where the space is a real word boundary.
#
# Each candidate is scored on the runs it makes. Run counts are taken from the tokens that carry no
# break, the paper's own undamaged vocabulary, and then flattened to maximum entropy the way
# radix flattens the pooled counts of two dialects: a run common everywhere contributes nothing
# however common it is, and the rest is the part that belongs to this candidate. A restoration
# the language actually has makes runs the paper already uses. A wrong one makes runs nobody wrote.
#
# WHAT MAKES IT A MEASUREMENT AND NOT A GUESS
#
# The same scoring is run with the paper's marks replaced by marks drawn at random from the same
# inventory, many times, and the rate at which a random mark scores as well as the winner is reported
# beside it. A site where the winner does not beat the random draws is a site this cannot read, and
# it says so instead of answering.
