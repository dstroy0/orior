# Nine papers have a reader written against their layout, and what those readers produce is named
# for the speaker, the language and the year, because the paper states all three. The other 143
# state those things too, in prose nobody has read.
#
# So what comes out of here is a different kind of thing and is kept apart from the nine. It goes
# to build/corpora/sifted/, one file per paper, and it carries no speaker and no language name.
# Guessing either from a filename would put a name on somebody's words on no evidence, and the
# rest of this directory exists to avoid exactly that.
#
# What each line does carry is where it came from and how far outside English it fell. A person
# opening one paper can start at the strongest lines and work down. These are candidates. A line
# here has been found, not read.
