#
# A sifted file carries no language name because taking one from a filename would be inventing it.
# The paper does not have that problem. It names its language in its title and its abstract, often
# several times and under several names.
#
# The name is read off the paper, never assigned. Each language below is listed with the names the
# literature uses for it, including the ones communities use for themselves and the older names
# outsiders gave them, because a 1974 paper and a 2024 paper on the same language rarely agree. A
# paper is attributed only where its front matter names one language and no other, which leaves the
# comparative papers unattributed, correctly.

    A marker the repository produces, such as build/, is absent from a linked worktree and a

    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree
    with no git directory, and it looks for src/python, which the repository tracks and every checkout
    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
    returning the current directory instead of the root.
