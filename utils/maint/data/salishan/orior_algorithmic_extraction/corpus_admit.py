# Admit sifted candidates into a pure corpus, one batch at a time, on the corpus's own curve.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/orior_algorithmic_extraction/corpus_admit.py
#
# A candidate does not have to look like a member. The corpus at this n has not seen its own
# alphabet: support is still climbing on every one of these languages. Resembling what is
# already there is the wrong test and would keep the corpus small forever.
#
# What can be asked is whether the corpus stays on its curve. A pure corpus growing on more of the
# same language adds support slowly and holds its split-half distance roughly level. Tipping in the
# whole sifted set does neither: a refused corpus's cells and D_self jump together, which is a second
# distribution arriving, not more of the first. The Salishan research paper gives the figures, which
# instrument_figures.py measures.
#
# So candidates are sorted by distance to the corpus and admitted in batches while D_self stays
# inside the band the corpus was already in. Admission stops at the first batch that leaves it.
# Admitted rows are written out. The rest is kept, with the batch number that rejected it. The
# boundary is then visible and not left implied.

    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree

    of it holds.
