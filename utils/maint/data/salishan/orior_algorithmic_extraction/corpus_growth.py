# Where each pure corpus's distribution is going as it grows.

#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/orior_algorithmic_extraction/corpus_growth.py
#
# A corpus of n members is a sample of a distribution instead of the distribution. A candidate that looks
# nothing like anything already in the corpus is therefore not disqualified: at this n the
# corpus does not yet cover its own support, and support is still climbing.
#
# So the question is not whether a candidate resembles a member. It is whether the corpus with the
# candidate in it is still on the curve the corpus was already on. This prints that curve, per
# language. The shape is visible before anything is decided by it.
#
# D_self is the estimator's resolution at each n, section 3. supp and H are section 4, reported
# beside it because D_self falls as the distribution concentrates and would otherwise be read as a
# fact about the language when it is a fact about the sample.
