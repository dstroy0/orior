# Can the algorithm find a dialect border it was never told about?
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/orior_algorithmic_extraction/boundary_check.py
#
# Lushootseed is not one dialect. The northern and southern varieties have known land and family
# borders, and Mellesmoen and Kye's stress paper labels every form it cites with which one it came
# from. The hand extraction copied that label into the who column. The border is on disk as a
# fact from the paper.
#
# That makes it the only thing a test of this algorithm needs and almost never has: an answer that
# did not come from the algorithm. Scoring the sift against a split the sift proposed proves
# nothing and passes forever. Scoring it against a split a linguist published is a test.
#
# The measurement is blind. The labels are loaded, then set aside, then the forms are partitioned in
# two by the sift with no label in sight, and only then are the two compared. The number reported is
# how much of the published border the partition recovered.
#
# WHY THE WORD WEB IS IN HERE
#
# Section 3 of the method resolves at 6707 bytes. The northern forms are about a thousand bytes all
# together, three orders below that. The byte pair distribution cannot be asked this question at
# all and says so. The web is what can: a shape edge is a shared leading or trailing run of four
# characters, and stress and vowel differences between the two varieties land in exactly those runs.
# Both are measured here and the gap between them is the point.
