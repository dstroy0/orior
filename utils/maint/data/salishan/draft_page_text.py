# Write a first draft of what the page says, for a paper whose text is the font's encoding.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/draft_page_text.py <stem>
#
# Writes build/papers/<stem>.page.txt, line for line with the extraction, and a page of one is a page
# of the other. Every rule it applies is in lyon_encoding.py, and the file it writes is a draft: it
# is not the paper until a person has read the rendered page beside it.
#
# closed_spaces is not applied here, although these papers do break words. Its rule is that a space
# after a stacked mark is inserted, and in these two the space lands in front of the mark instead:
# the extraction writes c ’kaPít@t for ck̓aʔítət. Running it after the map welds the wrong pairs,
# turning sti ’m uì into stim̓uɬ, because the mark now sits at the end of a token. Which of these
# spaces is a word boundary is what the page settles: iP ’kl is two words and i ’klíP is one.

    A marker the repository produces, such as build/, is absent from a linked worktree and a

    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree
    with no git directory, and it looks for src/python, which the repository tracks and every checkout
    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
    returning the current directory instead of the root.
