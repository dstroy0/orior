# The word web: every form the hand extractions hold, joined to the forms it is related to.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/word_web/word_web.py
#           from word_web import web, concept_profile
#
# The orior squashes text to a distribution over byte pairs and asks how far two of those
# distributions are apart. That works and it needs no per-language term, but it is the page as
# bytes: it cannot see that cítxʷ and citxw are the same word written twice, and it cannot see that
# a Nuxalk word and a Lushootseed word mean the same thing.
#
# The web carries that. It has three kinds of edge and each is measured off the extraction
# instead of listed by hand:
#
#   concept    two forms whose glosses share a content word. This is the edge that crosses
#              orthographies and dialects, because a concept is the only thing both papers wrote in
#              English. It turns an anchor into a concept expressed as a distribution instead of
#              a bag of characters.
#   shape      two forms of one language sharing a leading or trailing run of at least SHAPE_RUN
#              characters. Salish morphology is heavily affixed and reduplicating. A shared run
#              is usually a shared root or a shared affix. It is a measurement, not a parse.
#   context    two forms written in the same section of the same paper by the same speaker. Words
#              that turn up together in one telling are related by that telling.
#
# The web is per language and is written to build/corpora/<language>.web.tsv. Nothing here decides
# what a language is: the who column of the extraction says, and where it says northern or southern,
# the paper said so.
