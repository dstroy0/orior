#
# The text under build/papers is what pypdf could recover, and on these papers that is not what the
# page says. Lyon's Okanagan comes out as ˇx@cm@ncut where the page prints x̌əcməncut: the caron
# arrives before its letter, the schwa as @, the glottal stop as P. Words break mid-token, and the
# five-line interlinear arrives one token per line with the surface run into its own parse.
#
# A hand extraction taken off that text records the extractor. The page is the source. The page
# is what gets read, and the images go under build/pages. That path reaches pages/ in the closed
# corpus, the way build/papers and build/oracles reach papers/ and oracles/. A paper's PDF, its
# text and the pictures a reader worked from all sit in one place.

    A marker the repository produces, such as build/, is absent from a linked worktree and a
    never-built clone, and a climb to it can pass this root and land in another checkout whose paths
    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree
    with no git directory, and it looks for src/python, which the repository tracks and every checkout
    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
    inherits it answers about that repository and not about the directory it was asked from,
    returning the current directory instead of the root.
