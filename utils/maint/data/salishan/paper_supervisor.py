#
# WHY A PLAN FILE AND NOT A LOOP
#
# 993 papers is more than one run. A loop that walks the index start to finish loses everything it
# learned the moment it is interrupted, and the next run re-asks the server for what it already
# has. The plan is a table on disk: every paper, its address, its state, and what happened last
# time. Any of the four commands above can be run in any order, any number of times, and each one
# only touches rows whose state gives it something to do.
#
# THE STATES
#
#   missing    in the index, not on disk
#   held       the PDF is on disk
#   text       the PDF is on disk and its text is beside it. The readers need this one
#   errored on    the server answered with something that is not a PDF, and said why
#
# WHERE THE BYTES COME FROM
#
# --fetch asks the archive, exactly the way get_papers.py does, with the same named client and the
# same pause. Where the archive answers with a browser verification page instead of a file, that is
# a check meant to be passed by a person, and the run stops and says so. It is not retried, not
# routed around, and not asked again from somewhere else. Two ways past it, both of them real:
#
#   Ask the archive for bulk access. The client string names a contact for exactly this.
#   Download in a browser and point --adopt at the download directory.
#
# --adopt makes the second route cheap. Download a batch however many at a time, drop them in, and
# it verifies each one is a PDF, names it by its stem, converts it, and marks the row. --remaining
# then prints the addresses still needed, and that list is the next batch to download.
