# A known-answer run: does meaning-matched vocabulary from the oracles recover the accepted Salish
# subgrouping? Nothing new is claimed about the subgrouping. It is the check the other experiments in
# this directory have to pass before a comparison across languages built on these tables is trusted.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/experiments/subgrouping_check.py [ORACLES] [PERMUTATIONS]
#
# Forms are reduced to Dolgopolsky sound classes (labial P, dental T, sibilant and affricate S,
# velar and uvular K, lateral fricative and affricate L, liquid R, nasals M and N, glides W and J;
# vowels and laryngeals dropped), after the practical orthographies' digraphs are read as one sound
# and a nominalizing s- is set aside. Two forms of one meaning are counted as a match when their first
# two classes agree, the criterion Turchin, Peiros and Gell-Mann (2010) use. Their paper is cited from
# report and was not read for this file. The criterion is coarse by design: it survives the dozen
# orthographies in these tables, and chance matches are measured instead of assumed away.
#
# For each pair of languages, the match rate over the meanings both attest is set against the rate
# when one language's meanings are shuffled. The excess, observed minus shuffled, is the signal.
#
# Fixed before the first run, the check passes when:
#   (a) each Interior language's highest-excess Salish partner is Interior,
#   (b) each Central Salish language's highest-excess Salish partner is Central Salish,
#   (c) the mean excess among Interior pairs and among Central pairs each exceeds the mean excess
#       between an Interior and a Central language,
#   (d) no language outside the family has an excess with a Salish language above the largest excess
#       its own shuffles produce for that pair.
# Criterion (d) as fixed depends on how many shuffles are run: Kwak'wala with ʔayʔaǰuθəm failed it at
# 200 and passed at 500. It is replaced, after that run and recorded as a change, by: no pair of an
# outside language and a Salish language has a shuffle p below 0.01 (0.05 divided across the pairs
# tested would be stricter still).
