# How a glottalized resonant fares under reduplication, language by language, measured on the oracle
# forms and set against the survey that asked.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/salishan/experiments/reduplication_glottalization.py [ORACLES] [with-survey]
#
# Mellesmoen and Urbanczyk (2021, "Some Remarks on the Distribution and Representation of Glottalized
# Resonants in Salish", ICSNL 56, pp. 244-270, read in full from the corpus copy) classify each Salish
# language in their Table 4 by what reduplication does to a glottalized resonant: both copies
# glottalized (their Glottalized + Glottalized), or one copy plain (their Plain + Glottalized), with
# Upriver Halkomelem having no glottalized resonants and five languages left Unclear: Pentlatch,
# Sechelt, Upper Chehalis, Cowlitz and Bella Coola. They write that "the blanks in the charts can serve
# as a guide for further research".
#
# What is counted. Every form row of a Salish language is read as segments, a glottalized resonant
# being m, n, l, w, y or r carrying a comma above or followed by an apostrophe. A form is taken as
# doubled when its consonant skeleton, with glottalization set aside, holds some pair of consonants
# twice in a row (qən̓qən̓, həlhíləm), the shape of CVC reduplication. Where a resonant of that pair is
# glottalized in either copy, the pair is scored IDENTICAL (glottalized in both copies) or SPLIT
# (glottalized in one). Each doubled consonant pair is counted once per language, however many words
# carry it, and a footnote number stuck to a word's end is taken off first. The skeleton test also
# catches a root that repeats a consonant pair without being reduplicated. The known languages are
# scored first, and the test is trusted for the Unclear ones only if it sorts those.
#
# The survey's own two papers are left out of the count unless the run is given "with-survey". The
# agreement with Table 4 is then not the survey agreeing with itself.
