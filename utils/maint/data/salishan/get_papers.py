# The rest of the pipeline needs build/papers/, and the instructions used to be "download the PDFs,
# convert each to text, and name the text file after the PDF". That is three chances to get it wrong
# before anything runs, and one of them is silent.
#
# THE ENCODING, AND WHY IT DECIDES THE REST
#
# pdftotext writes Latin-1 unless told otherwise, and Latin-1 has no ʔ, no ə and no ɬ. A paper
# converted that way still opens, still looks like a paper, and has had the language taken out of
# it. Given -enc UTF-8 it keeps the characters and reorders the page: it lays text out by position,
# and a running header then prints before the title it sits above while a two-column table comes out
# interleaved.
#
# pypdf reads a page in the order the PDF stores it, the order the readers were written
# against. That was checked. Converting Mellesmoen_Kye_ICSNL61.pdf here gives 1462 lines identical,
# in order, to the copy the readers were built on, and all 146 PDFs on disk reproduce their held
# text exactly.
#
# WHERE THE ADDRESSES COME FROM
#
# One page lists every ICSNL paper ever published, 993 of them, each as a direct link. So there is
# no list of addresses to keep here and none to go stale: the page is read and the paper is found on
# it by name. The name is the PDF's own filename, which is also what build/papers/ calls it.
