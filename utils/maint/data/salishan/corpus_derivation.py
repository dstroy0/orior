# Estimate how wrong the pure corpus could be, and write the estimate as a document.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/data/salishan/corpus_derivation.py
#
# Run after every change to a hand extraction. This file reads the checks, computes a bound on the
# per-line error rate of the pure corpus, and rewrites the corpus derivation chapter in theory/.
#
# WHY A BOUND AND NOT A RATE
#
# Every check that matters reports zero. Zero failures in N trials is not a failure rate of zero: it
# is a sample that has not yet seen one. The bound that goes with it is the rule of three, which
# says that with no failures in N independent trials the true rate is under 3/N with 95 percent
# confidence. That is the honest reading of a clean check and it is what this file reports.
#
# WHERE THE SMALL NUMBERS COME FROM
#
# A single channel cannot get far. 3/N with N in the tens of thousands is about 10^-4, and driving
# that to 10^-26 by counting alone would take 10^26 tokens. The small number comes from a line
# having to pass several checks that fail for different reasons. The joint bound is the product.
# The product is only as good as the independence, and Section 4 of the document says exactly where
# that assumption is thin. A number quoted without it is a decoration.
