# Get real dates for the cookery books, for Section 4.13 of theory/workbooks/orior.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/fetch/recipe_dates.py
#
# Dating these books by the earliest year printed in their opening pages put a 1919 cookbook in 1600,
# because the first four digit number in a file is as likely to be a street address, a page count or a
# year mentioned in a preface as it is to be a date of publication. Every reading that used those dates
# is void, including a correlation against time and a comparison of one century against another.
#
# The files are named by the catalog's own numbers. The catalog can be asked directly. It gives
# the author's dates, which is not a publication date either, but an author's lifetime bounds when a
# book could have been written and does not depend on what number happens to appear first in a preface.
# The distinction is kept in the output: this is when the author lived, and it is used as a date only
# because it is the honest one available.
