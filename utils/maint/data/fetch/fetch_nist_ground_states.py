# Fetch the measured ground-state electron configurations from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/fetch/fetch_nist_ground_states.py [--refresh]
#
# The particle_physics oracle stage reads these. The ideal Madelung filling in
# representation/atom/element.py is the model, and this is the measurement it is held against: where a
# real atom fills against the order, chromium and the rest, the two disagree, and that disagreement is
# the aufbau exception the oracle reports.
#
# One request for the whole range covers it. The archive is asked once. The NIST database is a
# public service run by people; a second run costs it nothing, and this caches. No second run is
# needed. The tool errors on an empty or truncated response instead of writing a short file that a
# later reader would take for the whole table.
#
# The database carries measured spectra to element 110. Elements 111 to 118 have no measured
# configuration, only predictions. They are absent here, and the oracle reports them as
# unmeasured and does not invent a row for them.
