# Widen build/cod toward a corpus that actually contains doping, and record which family each
# entry came from.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/fetch/fetch_cod_doped.py [target_total]
#
# WHY A SECOND NAME LIST
#
# The list in examples/crystallography/6_oracle/proof_positive_control.py was chosen for cells
# likely to be published with right angles, because that oracle could not read anything else. It is
# a list of simple, mostly stoichiometric compounds, and a stoichiometric compound is by definition
# the case with no doping in it. Measured on the 650 entries that list produced, 54 carried a mixed
# site. The sample was thin in the one property a doping detector exists to find.
#
# The names below are solid solution formers: minerals whose published entries routinely put two
# elements on one crystallographic position. Olivine runs magnesium to iron, plagioclase runs sodium
# to calcium, the garnets and spinels and pyroxenes substitute across whole sites.
#
# WHY THE NAMES ARE GROUPED
#
# A mineral name is not the unit anybody reasons about. Forsterite and fayalite are the endpoints of
# one solid solution and asking whether forsterite dopes differently from fayalite is asking whether
# the magnesium end of olivine differs from the iron end, which is a question about one family and
# not two minerals. Grouping here means every entry carries the family it was fetched under, written
# to families.tsv beside the cache. A reading can report by family without guessing from a name.
#
# The family is provenance and not chemistry. It records the search term that returned the entry,
# which is a fact about how the corpus was built. An entry the archive returned for "olivine" that
# is not an olivine is still recorded as fetched under olivine, because that is how it happened. A
# reading that needs true mineral classification has to get it from the deposit and not from here.
#
# THE RIGHT ANGLE RESTRICTION IS DELIBERATELY NOT APPLIED
#
# Most of these are monoclinic or triclinic. The exact reading path does not need a right angle: it
# multiplies a fractional coordinate by an edge length and never consults a cell angle. The doping
# measure needs even less than that, reading only the atom site loop.
#
# WHAT THIS COSTS SOMEBODY ELSE
#
# The archive is a public service run by people. PAUSE below is the gap between requests that
# actually reach it and it is not negotiable. A cached entry waits for nothing. A second run over
# the same names is free to them and nearly free here.
#
# At a target in the thousands this route stops being the polite one. COD publishes an rsync mirror
# for bulk copying and one rsync is cheaper for them than ten thousand requests. Use
# fetch_cod_bulk.py for those. This stays the right tool for a targeted few hundred.

#
# Set against the target and not for its own sake. At 60 the name list tops out well short of
# ten thousand, because most names return fewer than sixty and the overlap between related names is
# large.
#
# Raising it alone would undo what it was introduced for. Walking the families in order with a high
# cap lets olivine and feldspar reach the target before the sulfides are asked, the
# same one family corpus the cap was added to prevent, arriving by a different route. The names are
# therefore interleaved across families below. The cap governs how deep a single name goes and
# the interleave governs how evenly the families are sampled. Neither setting is sufficient alone.
