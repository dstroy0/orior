# Fetch the Cell Tracking Challenge datasets for theory/workbooks/cell_tracking.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/fetch/fetch_ctc.py                 list the manifest, fetch nothing
#           python maint/data/fetch/fetch_ctc.py --fetch NAME     one dataset, training arm
#           python maint/data/fetch/fetch_ctc.py --fetch NAME --test   the test arm as well
#           python maint/data/fetch/fetch_ctc.py --tier small     every dataset under 200 MB
#
# NOTHING IS FETCHED BY DEFAULT. The full table is about 3.4 GB of 2D
# training data and about 360 GB of 3D, and one row of it, Fluo-N3DL-TRIF, is 320 GB training
# against 467 GB test on its own. A fetcher that pulls its whole manifest on a bare invocation is a
# fetcher that fills a disk before anyone reads its output. Run it bare first and read the total.
#
# WHERE THIS WRITES. repos/external/datasets at tree level, outside this repository, flat names and
# no nesting. That directory is not a git repository at all. Nothing here can be committed by
# accident. The rule this repo's .gitignore already states is the same one: what a tool can fetch is
# not carried here. The repository keeps this manifest.
#
# WHY THESE DATASETS AND NOT A LEADERBOARD. The permutation null measure carries most of the
# findings in this work and has no positive control from outside it, which theory/workbooks/orior calls the
# largest single gap in the work. The shift agreement detector has three, all from published crystal
# cell edges. These datasets ship published ground truth tracking annotations, a
# positive control: an answer that existed before the measurement and was not supplied by it.
#
# TWO ROWS ARE NOT LIKE THE OTHERS AND THEY ARE THE ONES TO START ON. The marker the challenge
# writes as a cross, here `perfect`, means the segmentation masks are exact because the data is
# computer generated. On those rows a tracking error is a linking error and cannot be a segmentation
# error, which separates the two halves of the problem. Every other row carries `silver`, meaning
# the reference segmentation is itself an annotation and a reading against it is bounded by how good
# that annotation is. Start where the segmentation cannot be blamed.
