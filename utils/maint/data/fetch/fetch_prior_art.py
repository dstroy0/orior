# not a shadow library.
#
# A paywalled article is recorded and left. Three attempts against Baeza-Yates and Regnier returned
# 403, the last against the publisher's own tokened link, and retrying a paywall does not open it.
# The entry for it in the ledger says unread, the honest state and is worth more than a

#
# The unmet list is the point of running this. A row that fails prints what it was, why it failed,
# and the best URL a person could try by hand. The failure is a worklist item and not a silence.
