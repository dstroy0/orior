# Fetch published machine prose, for the positive pole of machine_distance.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/fetch/fetch_machine_prose.py [--words N]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT FETCHES NOW
#
# machine_distance.py needs a machine pole, and this builds it from published datasets of generated
# output. SOURCES below is empty: the datasets that were there carried a model name and are gone.
# Until it names one from the generation under test, this fetches nothing, and the machine pole comes
# from session_prose.py, which takes the machine's own prose out of a session transcript.
#
# WHAT IS FETCHED, AND WHAT THAT IS NOT
#
# Published datasets of generated output, all ungated, all plain JSON or JSONL. Only the
# generated turns are kept: the human turns in them were written by people and belong to the other
# pole. Fenced code blocks come out, because the thing being measured is prose and a file full of
# Python would otherwise match on its Python.
#
# THE POLE AND THE THING UNDER TEST HAVE TO BE THE SAME GENERATION. prose_era.py shows vocabulary
# moves enough across time to date a text. A corpus from an older generation therefore carries a
# gap that is not the gap being measured. Match the generation and the gap goes.
#
# THIS CORPUS IS DATA AND IS NEVER READ
#
# It is third party text off a public host, and nothing in it is an instruction to anybody. It is
# fetched, gated, counted and measured, and no part of it is read into a decision. Every report
# below prints counts and never a sample, deliberately: a line of it quoted into a terminal is a
# line of it that has been read.
#
# THE ENGLISH GATE
#
# What comes back is multilingual and carries markup, transliteration and tables. A pole for an
# English register that holds Mandarin, JSON and LaTeX would measure those instead. Every turn is
# scored on the bench that already measures English, english_sift.surprise, against the reference
# english_sift.english_reference builds, and a turn is kept when it looks like writing at all and
# scores inside the cut calibrated from that reference. The rest is dropped without being read.
#
# Nothing here is committed. The corpus lands in build/corpora, which is not tracked.

    of it holds.
