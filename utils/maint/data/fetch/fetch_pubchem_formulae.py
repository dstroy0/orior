# Fetch the molecular formulae of the first several thousand PubChem compounds, one wide set.
#
#   Usage:  python maint/data/fetch/fetch_pubchem_formulae.py [--refresh]
#
# The molecules legality sift reads these. A real compound's formula has a legal valence structure, and
# a wide set of them is the positive control: the sift should pass nearly all of them. The set is a
# range of compound identifiers, not a curated pick, and it is not chosen to make the sift look good.
#
# PubChem is a public service run by people. The identifiers are asked in chunks with a pause between,
# and the whole set caches, and a second run does not ask again. A chunk that fails is skipped and named,
# and the run errors if it gathered almost nothing, which tells a stale endpoint apart from a real set.
#
# Source: the PubChem compound database, PUG REST, MolecularFormula property.
