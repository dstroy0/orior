"""Is the word-pair distribution anything but the light cone and the register chains?

Seen from above, the word-pair shadow looks weighted from left to right. It has to be: input word
w is outside the cone for exactly w rounds. The volume of dead plateau in a row is set by which
word it is, and the weighting follows from the geometry with nothing left to explain.

The question worth asking is what remains once that is removed. Aligning every input word to its
own wavefront takes the cone out, and the rest is the eight output words, which are two chains
of four: a, b, c, d are a delayed nought to three rounds, and e, f, g, h are e delayed the same.

So the prediction is exact. At a fixed offset past the wavefront the eight output words should show
two groups of four, each group stepping with its delay, and no other structure.
