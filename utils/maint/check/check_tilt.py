"""Tests a visual claim: periodic spikes in the input-bit shadow, aligned at a tilt.

Seen from the front at ground level the voxel field appears to hold distinct spikes running deep,
periodic across the input bits and leaning at a constant angle. A tilt is a fixed ratio of bits to
rounds, and the message schedule predicts exactly one: thirty-two bits per round, because a word is
thirty-two bits wide and each enters one round after the last. Anything else would be new.

Two questions, and the second only matters if the first survives.

  is anything there deep?   the excess per input bit past round 23, against its own scatter
  is it periodic?           autocorrelation of that profile in the bit index, where a period of
                            32 is the word structure and any other period is not accounted for
