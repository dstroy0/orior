"""Does the field ever gain structure, or only lose it?

Reading color saturation as construction and desaturation as destruction predicts sharply:
a hash should destroy structure and never build it. The total field power should fall at every
round and rise at none. A rise would be a construction event and would want explaining.

Total power here is the signed residue fold summed in magnitude over all thirty-two classes. That
is the entire field with the sign folded out and nothing further discarded.

Two things have to be separated. A monotone run while the field is still large is a real statement
about the function. Rises after the field has reached its floor are not construction: each round is
its own seed. Consecutive rounds are independent draws and about half of them will land higher
than the one before whatever the function does.
