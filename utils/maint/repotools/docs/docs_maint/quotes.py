"""Every quotation in src/, checked against the RFC text it says it came from.

docs/learn/RFC/README.md states the rule this enforces: "Read the section, do not recall it." A
comment that puts an RFC sentence in quotation marks is making a claim that can be settled, because
the sentence is sitting in docs/learn/RFC. Nothing else in the tree settles it - a quotation drifts
by a word and neither compiler, test nor reviewer reading the comment against the code will see it,
because the comment still says something true about the code. What it stops being true about is the
RFC.

    python tools/dev_env/quotes.py            the report
    python tools/dev_env/quotes.py --check    exit nonzero when any quotation's words differ
    python tools/dev_env/quotes.py --list     also print the ones that matched, and how

Three outcomes, and the difference between the first two is the whole design:

  verbatim   found in the RFC with only its typesetting undone - the [Page n] footer, the form feed
             and the running header removed, and words rejoined across the 72-column wrap.

  retyped    found once both sides are reduced to their words. This is what a faithful quotation
             still differs by, and none of it is an error: a nested quotation has to turn " into ',
             a reflowed list gains the commas the RFC wrote as line breaks, a sentence cut short
             gains a period, and RFC 9293 numbers requirements inline - "An application MUST
             (MUST-21) be able to" - which a quotation reasonably drops.

  differs    the words themselves are not the RFC's. Either the quotation is a paraphrase wearing
             quotation marks, or it is quoted accurately from a different RFC than the one named.

Getting the first two apart from the third is most of the work, and every normalization here was
put in after a correct quotation was reported as an invention:

  - Page furniture goes line by line. Taking the line either side of the form feed as well ate the
    body text abutting a page break, and RFC 2236's report-suppression sentence - quoted correctly
    in igmp.h - came back as a miss.
  - A hyphen at the wrap is ambiguous and the text cannot settle it. RFC 8200 breaks
    "first-arriving" where the hyphen IS the wrap; RFC 9293 breaks "option-length" where it belongs
    to the word. Both readings are built and either may match. Reading every break as a wrap loses
    the second kind.
  - A run of // lines is one comment. code_mask marks the newline ending a // comment as code.
    Reading the mask alone gives one block per line and truncates
    every quotation spanning two of them. That was hiding 591 quotations - two fifths of the total
    - and every one of the odd quote-mark counts that made blocks unreadable.
  - A block often cites a bare "sec 5.4.2" against the document the FILE is about and not the
    last RFC it happened to name. dad.h quotes six RFC 4862 sections that way. The RFCs in the
    file's own @file comment are tried as well, or those six read as inventions.

  A comment block whose quote marks still do not pair after all that is skipped and not guessed
  at, and the report says which. With an odd count every candidate after the stray mark is the gap
  BETWEEN two quotations, and each would be reported as an invented sentence.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT SETTLE. An RFC figure, state table or pseudo-code block is laid out in columns
with rules through it, and a phrase quoted out of one does not appear as running text: RFC 2236's
"send report, set flag, start timer" is three table cells. Those come back as differing and are not
wrong. Neither is a quoted phrase that was never the RFC's - the title of another work, a field
name, a label - which this cannot tell from a quotation. Read the differing list, do not act on its
count.

Not a pass/fail gate by default, for the same reason harness.py deps and unwired.py are not: a
paraphrase in quotation marks is a real defect but it is a documentation defect, and failing a
build on one would put pressure on the wrong thing. --check is there for when you want it held.
