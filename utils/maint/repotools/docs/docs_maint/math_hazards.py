# Find the characters and commands inside a document's math that break before the math is rendered.
#
#   Usage:  python docs/docs_maint/math_hazards.py <document.md> [more.md]
#
# Markdown gets the first pass at the text and the math renderer gets the second. Anything that means
# something to markdown or to HTML is consumed before the formula is ever parsed. Three of these turned up
# in one paper and none of them reported the cause.
#
# A pair of asterisks in one block, as in \pi^{*} used twice, is read as emphasis and the LaTeX between
# them is rewritten. The error that surfaces complains about a brace, because the braces around the
# asterisks are what got eaten.
#
# A raw < is read as the start of a tag and swallows what follows it.
#
# A command the renderer does not carry throws instead of degrading. \operatorname is absent from some
# builds, \mathbb takes only uppercase letters so \mathbb{1} fails, and \mathfrak needs a font that is
# often not shipped.
#
# So the rule this checks is that a character with a meaning in markdown has to be written as a command:
# \ast for the asterisk, \lt and \gt for the angle brackets. Nothing here is repaired. It reports where to
# look, and a hit is a hazard instead of a proven failure, since which of these break depends on the
# renderer the reader happens to use.
