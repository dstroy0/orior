#
# WHY A NUMBER AND NOT A PATH
#
# The theory research papers cite examples, and a path is the wrong identifier for that. A file that moves
# breaks every citation to it, and this tree has already reorganized examples once, from
# examples/language_testing/natural_languages into examples/language/4_measure, leaving 190 of 252
# cited paths pointing at nothing. A catalog number survives a move. At 98 examples the paths were
# still followable by hand; at a thousand they will not be.
#
# HOW A NUMBER IS BUILT
#
#   LNG-4-012      domain, pipeline stage, ordinal within that pair
#
# The domain is the directory under examples/ and the stage is the numbered directory under it, and
# a reader knows where to look before opening the registry. The ordinal is assigned once.
#
# ASSIGNED ONCE, NEVER RECOMPUTED
#
# catalog.tsv is the registry and it is append only. Numbering alphabetically on every run would be
# simpler and would be wrong: one example added at the head of a directory would renumber everything
# after it and silently invalidate every citation already written down. A new file takes the next
# free ordinal in its own domain and stage. A deleted file keeps its number, retired and never
# reissued. A citation to it then resolves to a retirement instead of to another file.
#
# A MOVE KEEPS THE NUMBER AND CHANGES THE PREFIX
#
# Those disagree, and the registry keeps the number it issued. An example that moves from one domain
# to another is the same example. --assign updates the path against the existing number and
# leaves the number alone, prefix included. The prefix says where it was first filed; the path in
# the registry says where it is.

# EXP is the VIZ case again and not a ninth subject. 0_experimental holds work that reads no
# corpus yet. It names no domain in the sense the others do, and its files take stage x like

# move: an example that later earns a subject stage keeps the number it was issued here, and every
# citation written against it still resolves.

# VIZ is not a domain in the sense the other eight are. Those name what a corpus is of, and the
# viz tools read any blob: whatever arrives as points carrying values, with no domain in it. They
# sit first in the listing for that reason, and they carry numbers because they are tools this
# work uses, and a number survives a file moving where a path does not.
