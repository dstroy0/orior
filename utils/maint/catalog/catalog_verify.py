#
# Heuristics. Each one below is cheap, mechanical, and wrong sometimes. Not one reads what a
# script means. A finding here is a place worth opening and not a defect. The value is in
# the ratio: a hundred examples is more than anyone rereads, and this narrows it to the few where
# the header and the file disagree about something checkable.
#
# The register checker is next door and answers a different question. docs_check reads how a comment
# is written. This reads whether it is still true.
#
# THE CHECKS
#
#   usage        the Usage line names a path, and the file is at that path
#   stage        a 4_measure script imports from measure, a 1_represent one from representation
#   cites        the section a header points at exists in the theory it names
#   writes       a header saying it writes something has a write in it, and the reverse
#   fetches      a header saying it fetches has a network call in it, and the reverse
#   silent       a script with no output call, which usually means a header promising a report
#   catalog      the stamped number matches the registry
#
# WHY THE PAIRS RUN BOTH WAYS
#
# A header that promises less than the code does is the more dangerous half and the easier one to
# miss. A script described as reading a corpus that also writes one has an effect nobody reviewing
# the description would expect, and it will be run by somebody who read only the description.
