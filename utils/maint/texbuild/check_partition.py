# What the partition says, checked instead of remembered.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/texbuild/check_partition.py [repository_root]
#
# The partition is a rule about which measurements reach the general public. Held as a rule someone
# remembers, it survives exactly as long as nobody builds a research paper without thinking about it. The name
# guard in hooks/pre-commit makes this argument about a product name and the argument is the same
# here, with a larger blast radius: a name in a banner is embarrassing, and a held chapter bound into
# a published PDF cannot be recalled from anyone who downloaded it.
#
# WHAT THIS CATCHES
#
# theory/theory/cryptography/sha256/main.tex includes eleven chapters. Six were published from orior.
# Five postdate them and are held. Nothing in the build errors on that combination, and `build_theory.sh`
# produces one PDF carrying both halves and looking finished. That is the defect this exists for.
#
# HOW IT FAILS
#
# Closed, in three directions. An unlisted artifact is HELD, and a new document is private until
# somebody classifies it and never public by being forgotten. PENDING is HELD, and an undecided
# judgment call cannot reach a public build by nobody getting round to the decision. A missing or
# unreadable manifest errors on the run outright, because a gate that skips itself when its input moves
# is worse than no gate: every build after that passes while still looking gated.
#
# Exit status is the count of findings, and it fails a pipeline without needing a flag.

# Order matters. A research paper takes the strictest class of anything it reaches, and strictness increases
# down this list.
#
# EXTERNAL is the precision work: arbitrary-precision arithmetic, the certified NTT moduli, integer
# relation detection. Douglas ruled it fair on 2026-09-11 - "precision fair" - because a
# general-purpose multiply does not reveal what it is aimed at, and the advantage is the aiming.
#
# It ranks with PUBLIC and not below it. PUBLIC means already published in orior and therefore
# settled; EXTERNAL means cleared for publication and not yet out. Neither constrains a research paper, and they
# carry the same strictness. Keeping them distinct leaves "cleared but unpublished" to be
# counted in place of assumed.
#
# An unknown class is NOT silently ranked. `strictest` used to reach into this table directly, and a
# typo in the manifest would have produced a KeyError at best and a wrong rank at worst; classify()
# now errors on a class this table does not name.
