# Build every theory research paper under theory/ with XeLaTeX, into build/theory/<research_paper>/.
#
#   Usage:  sh utils/maint/texbuild/build_theory.sh [<research_paper> ...]
#
# Two passes, because the table of contents is written on the first and read on the second. The
# engine is xelatex and not pdflatex: these research papers quote Salishan orthography, IPA and Greek, and
# pdflatex stops with a fatal error on the first Greek letter it meets. It is xelatex and not
# lualatex because arXiv runs xelatex and does not run lualatex, and a local build on a different
# engine from the archive's proves nothing about the archive's.
#
# Every output lands under build/, and one file is written beside the source: a research paper that
# builds clean has its PDF copied next to its main.tex, named after its directory. The PDF of
# theory/theory/delta_null is theory/theory/delta_null/delta_null.pdf. A paper that fails, or that
# drops a glyph, leaves the PDF beside its source as it was. A paper with a generate.sh beside its
# main.tex has it run first, and the files it generates are written where it puts them. With
# THEORY_GENERATE=0 no generate.sh runs and the paper is set from its files as they stand. The
# pre-commit hook calls this with THEORY_GENERATE=0.
#
# A missing glyph is reported by the engine as "Missing character" and is otherwise silent: the
# letter is dropped from the PDF and the run still succeeds. This script counts them and fails when
# any research paper drops one, because a research paper about a language that drops a letter of it is wrong.
