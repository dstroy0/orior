# Assemble one self-contained submission per research paper, in whatever shape the venue asks for.

#   python utils/maint/texbuild/submission_package.py --arxiv [<research_paper>] arXiv's shape, under build/arxiv/
#
# Writes build/submission/<research_paper>/ and, unless --archive none, an archive beside it. Nothing under
# theory/ is modified: the rewrite happens on the copy, and the source keeps the shared preamble it
# has always had.
#
# THE REQUIREMENT IS NOT ANY ONE VENUE'S
#
# A submission is a directory that compiles in place. Every venue enforces that and they
# differ only in what they want it wrapped in. arXiv extracts a tarball into one root and runs LaTeX
# there. Most journals ask for a zip. A repository deposit takes the directory as it stands. A venue
# that wants only the built PDF still needs the build to have worked somewhere.
#
# So the assembly and the checks below are the whole job and they are the same every time. The
# archive format is the only part that changes, and it is a flag.
# This started life as arxiv_package.py and that was the wrong shape: it made one venue's
# packaging look like a property of the work.
#
# WHY ANY OF IT IS NEEDED
#
# Every research paper reaches outside its own directory for the two files it shares with the others.
# theory/theory/Salishan/main.tex says \input{../preamble.tex} and theory/theory/cryptography/sha256/main.tex
# says \input{../../preamble.tex}, and preamble.tex then says \input{../macros.tex}. That resolves
# here because theory/ is the directory above them all, and it resolves nowhere else.
#
# The fix is not to restructure theory/, because one shared preamble across every research paper keeps
# a layout change reaching all of them. The fix is to copy the shared files into the research paper at
# packaging time and rewrite the lines that point at them.
#
# RESEARCH PAPERS ARE DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED
#
# build_theory.sh:26 records what happens otherwise. The four names were written into it once, and a
# research paper added after that line would not have built. Two research papers were missing from the tree's own
# documentation for the same reason, and a seventh was missing from README.md and from
# docs/research/index.md on the day it was created. This walks for main.tex at both depths so the
# packager cannot go stale the way a hand-written list does.
#
# WHAT IT ERRORS TO SHIP
#
# A submission still holding a climbing path is broken and fails on upload with a LaTeX error nobody
# can read. Every .tex in the assembled copy is re-read AFTER the rewrite, and a remaining ../ in an
# \input or \include fails that research paper and names the file and the line. A rule that was supposed to
# catch a path is not evidence that it did.
#
# It also errors instead of carrying what a LaTeX run leaves behind. See LEAVINGS.
#
# WHAT --arxiv ADDS, AND WHY EACH STEP IS THERE
#
# arXiv extracts a tarball into one directory and runs LaTeX there, and everything extracted becomes
# public whether or not the document reads it. That second half is the part that costs somebody
# later. The extra steps are mostly deletions:
#
#   flattened      Every subdirectory is emptied into the root and the \input and \include lines
#                  that named it are rewritten. Checked first for two files sharing a basename,
#                  because flattening those would destroy one of them silently.
#   comments gone  A full-line comment is deleted. A comment at the end of a line has its text
#                  deleted and its percent sign kept, because in LaTeX that percent sign eats the
#                  newline and dropping it inserts a space into the typeset page. Stripping it
#                  wholesale is the standard way this step goes wrong.
#   nothing hidden A dotfile or dot-directory is not copied. None is ever read by the document and
#                  each one is somebody's local state.
#   nothing unread A .tex no \input or \include chain reaches from main.tex is dropped. An old
#                  draft nobody compiles still publishes.
#   no notes       A Markdown file is dropped. The ones beside a research paper are working notes and logs,
#                  and LaTeX reads none of them. Any other file that is not source or a figure is
#                  named and kept.
#   four passes    \typeout just before \end{document} makes arXiv run LaTeX until the labels
#                  settle. It was once placed after \end{document}, where LaTeX has already stopped
#                  reading and the line never reached the log.
#   00README.json  The engine, the top-level file and the TeX Live release, in the JSON form arXiv
#                  reads (https://info.arxiv.org/help/00README.html, read 2026-09-23). Without it
#                  arXiv guesses the engine from the source, and these research papers need xelatex.
#   flat tarball   No wrapping directory. `tar -cvvf ax.tar *` produces that from inside
#                  the assembled copy.
#   metadata.txt   The title, the authors and the abstract with the LaTeX taken out and the line
#                  breaks collapsed, ready to paste into the web form. arXiv shows the whitespace
#                  that LaTeX ignores. The collapsing is not cosmetic.
#
# It does not submit anything and holds no credential. The tarball and the metadata are the whole
# output, and a person uploads them.
