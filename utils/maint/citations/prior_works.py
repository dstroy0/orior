# Two questions about prior work, asked of the research papers before they are published.
#
#   python utils/maint/citations/prior_works.py                 report both
#   python utils/maint/citations/prior_works.py --claims        priority claims only
#   python utils/maint/citations/prior_works.py --quotations    quoted passages only
#   python utils/maint/citations/prior_works.py <path> ...      named files or directories
#
# WHAT THIS ASKS
#
# Whether a source that IS named has been written down properly is one question. This asks the two
# that survive it.
#
#   1. A PRIORITY CLAIM WITH NOTHING BEHIND IT. A sentence saying something here is new, first,
#      unprecedented, or absent from the literature is a claim about everybody else's work. This
#      tree cannot check that kind of claim on its own, because the evidence for it
#      sits in journals nobody here has read. Either a reference stands near it, or the sentence
#      says plainly that nobody here has read it.
#
#   2. A QUOTED PASSAGE WITH NO ATTRIBUTION. Somebody else's sentences, set in quotation marks,
#      carried in a research paper that is about to be posted publicly under a license. Unattributed, it is
#      either a copyright problem or a note that was filed in the wrong place. docs_check already
#      finds these spans, to EXEMPT them from its own register checks. Nothing has been asking
#      whether they are attributed.
#
# THE MODEL FOR A GOOD PRIORITY CLAIM IS ALREADY IN THE TREE
#
# theory/theory/crystallography/chapters/chapter_whose_result.tex says an autocorrelation of density in a
# crystal is very unlikely to be new, that the reasonable prior is that it has a name and a
# literature behind it, and that nobody here has done the reading. That paragraph asserts no
# priority and states its own gap. It needs no citation and passes. Every DISCLAIMER pattern
# below was read off it.
#
# IT REPORTS. A PERSON DECIDES EACH SITE.
#
# No regex can tell a priority claim from a description of somebody else's priority. "no
# narrowed-width formula was found in the literature" is a claim this work is making; "Handschuh
# and Gilbert show" is a claim about theirs, and the second is what a citation looks like. The
# finding names the line and the reader opens it. Exit status is the count. A pipeline can fail
# on it without a flag, and nothing here errors on a commit on its own.
