# Compute the digests that a priority anchor is taken over. Keyless, and safe to run unattended.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/signing/build_manifest.py [--root DIR] [--also DIR] [--out FILE]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS NOW
#
# docs/provenance.md section 3 argues for a priority anchor and section 8 lists the apparatus as specified and
# not built. The gap matters more than it reads: this corpus is seven days old, it is unpublished, and
# its only evidence of date is the commit timestamps, which section 3 rules out by name because a
# commit date is written by the committer's own clock exactly as a signature's date field is.
#
# So today the priority position is nothing. Not weak, nothing.
#
# THE PROPERTY THAT MAKES THIS SAFE TO DO WHILE THE WORK IS STILL HELD
#
# An anchor is taken over a DIGEST. A digest discloses nothing: it is the same size for a sentence or
# a corpus, it cannot be inverted, and it names no file. So the held material can be anchored today
# and revealed whenever, and the anchor still proves the bytes existed on the day it was made.
#
# That resolves the tension that would otherwise stall this. Holding the research back and
# establishing priority over it are not in conflict, and waiting for publication to anchor is the
# expensive mistake, because every day unanchored is a day a competing claim can predate.
#
# Keep manifest.tsv itself private while the work is held. Publishing it later is what converts the
# anchor from "these bytes existed" into "these bytes, and here they are".
#
# WHAT IS KEYLESS AND WHAT IS NOT
#
# Everything here. Computing digests, assembling the queue, and checking that every listed file is
# present and unchanged need no secret. They run on any machine at any time. Signing is one
# command over one small file, run by the person holding the key, and it is in sign.ps1 for him.

# None of that is build output. The manifest had 342 rows and zero of them were from tools/audit.
#
# This is the failure mode the skip list has to be audited FOR: a file wrongly skipped is undated
