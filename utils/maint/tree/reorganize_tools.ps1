#
# The same job reorganize_src.ps1 did for src, and for the same reason: forty loose files in one
# directory is a list to read instead of a structure to navigate.
#
# NAMES DO NOT CHANGE, ONLY PATHS
#
# check_slant.py becomes check\check_slant.py and keeps its name. The repetition is deliberate.
# Every document, every printf inside a bench, and every usage line in a docstring names these files.
# A rename means finding all of those and being right every time. Inserting one directory level
# means the filename is still the search key. A previous mechanical rewrite in this tree corrupted a
# filename by matching a fragment of it; matching on the whole name cannot do that.
#
# WHAT DOES NOT MOVE
#
# research_paper and prose already exist and hold symlinks into orior.
# research_paper\build_theory.sh derives the
# repository root with dirname "$0"/../.., which is only correct at exactly that depth. Moving it
# deeper would break it silently. Both stay where they are.
