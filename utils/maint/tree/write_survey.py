# Every file this tree writes, and where it lands.
#
#   Usage:  python utils/maint/tree/write_survey.py [--all]
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# Generated output belongs under build/, and the harm from a stray is not that the file is wrong. It
# is that a person finds it months later beside the source, cannot tell whether it was written by
# hand or by a run, and has to open the tool to find out. A repository where that question has an
# answer only by inspection is a repository nobody can clean.
#
# So this reads every script for the places it opens a file for writing and reports the directory
# each one targets. A destination under build/ is correct and is counted and not listed. Anything
# else is named, because that is the list worth reading.
#
# WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT SEE
#
# The target is resolved from the source text and not from a run. A path built at runtime out of a
# variable this cannot follow comes back as unresolved and is reported that way instead of being
# guessed at. Unresolved writes are the calls a person still has to read, and they are counted
# separately so the resolved figures stay honest.
#
# Reading a file for writing is what is looked for, in the forms this tree actually uses: the open
# builtin with a mode carrying w, a or x, io.open the same way, and pathlib's write_text and
# write_bytes. os.makedirs is reported too, since a directory created outside build/ is the same
# question one step earlier.

    look valid. A marker infers the root. Git answers it. The climb below serves only an exported tree
    with no git directory, and it looks for archive/src/python, which the repository tracks and every checkout
    of it holds.

    Git's own variables are cleared first. Inside a hook GIT_DIR is exported, and a rev-parse that
