"""What a relation decides and what no cost reading can reach, measured instead of argued.

    python utils/maint/engine/order_check.py

The noiseless half of the query protocol. Seven checks, each one isolating a claim the method rests
on. Every number below is produced by the run and none is quoted from anywhere.

    7  gate-then-rank against one combined score
    8  how many arrangements a precept set leaves standing
    9  whether a precept set is independent
    10  whether agreement inside a floor defines a set at all
    11  what an answer costs when it is read outside what it was derived on
    12  whether two transitions in the document ever carry one name
    13  whether the two transition tables agree, and whether each reads alike from both sides

Nothing here is a measurement and nothing here carries noise. `utils/maint/engine/measure_check.py` holds
the noisy half as checks 1 through 6, and the separation between the two files is the separation the
two stages buy: a result in this file cannot be moved by anything in that one.

The numbering runs on from that file, which leaves every finding nameable by its number alone.

Nothing outside the standard library is reached for here, and the arithmetic wants nothing else.
