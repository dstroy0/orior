# THIS IS THE WINDOWS ENTRY POINT AND IT GETS THE GPU. A machine with a card renders on it without
# anyone asking, and three things have to line up for that which a bare configure does not do.
#
#   nvcc drives a host compiler. On Windows that is MSVC and it reaches PATH through vcvars, which
#   Git Bash does not run. Maint/engine/build_engine.sh finds nvcc unusable and skips CUDA. This
#   script imports that environment first.
#
#   The Visual Studio generator compiles .cu only where the toolkit installed its MSBuild
#   integration, which a normal install often skips, and CMake stops with "No CUDA toolset found".
#   Ninja needs no integration and is used where it is present.
#
#   nvcc is frequently not on PATH even where the toolkit is installed. The standard locations are
#   searched and the newest is put on PATH for the configure.
#
# Where any of that is missing the build still succeeds with the host arms and says what was
# skipped. A skipped device is reported, never silent.
