# Compile the CUDA arm for every architecture worth carrying and read the SASS that came out.

#
# WHAT THIS GRADE IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT
#
# One device is present here, an RTX 3070 at compute 8.6, and the arm is run against the portable
# arm on it. Every other architecture below has no hardware here. The only check available is this:
# compile for that target, then disassemble the cubin and confirm real SASS for that architecture
# came out. An empty section or a PTX-only stub that would be JIT compiled later does not pass.
#
# That rules out a target the toolkit accepted and did not generate for, an intrinsic unavailable on
# that architecture, and a silent fallback to a lower compute capability. It says nothing about
# behavior, since nothing is run.
#
# Rows read "builds" and never "agrees". Only the run on the 3070 earns "agrees", and Ampere is the
# only line in this file that has it.
