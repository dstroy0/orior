# Grade the exact integer at every width a build may select, 1 limb to 32768, which is 32 bits to
# 1048576 bits.
#
#   bash utils/maint/engine/check_exact_widths.sh [--from N] [--to N] [--gpu]
#
#   --from N   narrowest limb count to grade (default 1)
#   --to N     widest limb count to grade (default 32768)
#   --gpu      also build and grade the CUDA arm at each width, through build_gpu_arm.sh
#
# Needs cmake, a C11 compiler and python on PATH. --gpu also needs what build_gpu_arm.sh needs:
# nvcc and an MSVC host compiler on Windows. No network and no submodule.
#
# At each power of two limb count this configures its own build tree under build/exact_widths/,
# builds bench_exact, bench_exact_arms and test_steer at that width, and runs three graders:
#
#   rows    bench_exact's limb results checked against python integers by check_exact_limbs.py
#   arms    every host arm graded against portable by bench_exact_arms
#   steer   test_steer, the engine's consumer of the exact integer
#
# The engine itself needs 8 limbs. Its dispatch rule reaches 143 bits on a 64 bit census, and
# src/cu/engine/nbody/orior/orior_internal.h errors on a narrower width at compile time. Below 8 limbs the
# steer column reads "-", since there is no engine at that width to grade. The exact integer is graded at
# every width regardless.
#
# The digit floor passed at each width is the largest the width holds, capped at the 1024 the
# header declares. A width below 4096 bits cannot hold 1024 digits, and exact_integer.h errors on it
# unless the build names a floor it does hold. The largest floor d satisfies d * 3322 < 1000 * bits,
# the same test the header's assert makes.
#
# The run shrinks as the width grows, and every width costs about the same. At 32768 limbs one
# position is 128 KiB, and the 4096 positions used at 128 limbs would be 512 MiB.
#
# One line per width, and a nonzero exit naming every width where any grader failed. A width that
# did not build counts as a failure. A binary that never ran reports zero disagreements, and that
# zero grades nothing.
