# Fail when the two arm families stop naming the same instruction sets.
#
#     python utils/maint/engine/check_arm_families.py
#
# The engine carries one operation per instruction set in two families: the steering scan in
# src/engine/nbody/orior/scan_<set>.c and the exact arithmetic in
# src/engine/arithmetic/no_rounding/arm_<set>.c.
# The CMake file states that a listing of the two directories names the same sets, because the
# portable arm is the reference in each and every other set exists to be faster at an answer portable
# already fixed. This check holds that invariant: it reads the two directories, takes the <set>
# suffix off every arm file, and exits non-zero when the two families disagree or when either family
# is missing its portable reference.
#
# It fails closed. A directory that does not resolve, or one that yields no arm at all, is a defect
# and exits non-zero instead of reporting an empty match as a pass. Every root it read is printed.
# A run that scanned the wrong tree says so instead of returning a number about a smaller tree than it
# names.
