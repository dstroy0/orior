#
# nvcc drives a host compiler and on Windows that host compiler is MSVC. The CMake build uses a
# different one, and objects from the two do not link. The device arm gets its own build exactly
# as the exact arm does in build_gpu_arm.sh. Everything this binary needs is compiled here by the one
# compiler nvcc is driving. That keeps the ABI consistent inside it.
#
# The result is bench_raster with the device arm compiled in. Without this script the CMake build
# still produces bench_raster, linking the stub arms in anchor_raster_output.c, and it reports the device as
# absent and grades the host alone. That is a skip.
