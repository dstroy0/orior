#
# WHAT THIS GRADE IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT
#
# Two of these arms have hardware here and are run against the portable arm on real data. AVX-512
# and SVE have no hardware here. The strongest available check: build for the
# target, disassemble, and confirm the instructions the arm was written to use are the instructions
# that came out.
#
# That is a real result and not a guess. It rules out a header that silently fell back to scalar
# code, an intrinsic the compiler emulated instead of issuing, and a flag that was accepted and
# ignored. What it does not touch is behavior: no value is computed, nothing is compared against the
# portable arm, and a logic error inside the vector loop would pass this check untouched.
#
# A row here reads "emits" and never "agrees". Only a run against portable earns "agrees", and
# the two words are kept apart.
