# Build the CUDA steering scan arm and grade it against the portable one.
#
#   bash utils/maint/engine/build_gpu_scan.sh [sm_XX ...]
#
# The companion of build_gpu_arm.sh, for the scan family instead of the exact one. nvcc needs a host
# compiler and on Windows that host compiler is MSVC, never MinGW. The rest of this tree builds with
# MinGW, and MinGW objects do not link against MSVC objects. The GPU arm gets its own build and
# does not join the CMake one. Everything it needs is compiled here by the same host compiler nvcc is
# driving. That keeps the ABI consistent inside this binary.
#
# Architectures default to the one this machine carries. Naming others compiles for them as well.
# That is how an architecture nobody here owns is checked: the code has to compile and the assembler
# has to accept it for that target, and only running it is left unverified.
