// gnascor_trace.c: a trace of real asks for gnascor_read.py, put to the host a cycle at a time
//
//     gnascor_trace <scenario> <trace>
//
// A scenario holds one line a cycle, a spec for each side: held, not, late or unasked. Each side is a run of asks
// put through query_ask (src/cu/transpiler/lstar/protocol/query_ask.h) between two reads of the clock, and the trace
// line written for it is the kind its asks came back as and the clock's advance across the run:
//
//     held     QUERY_EQUALS at a word the program owns, carrying the word it holds
//     not      QUERY_EQUALS at that word, carrying a word it does not hold
//     late     QUERY_ADVANCES at the clock itself: it holds, and each ask waits out a step of the clock
//     unasked  nothing is put, and the side is written as -
//
// The clock is the first word of the page every Windows process shares that the protocol finds advancing. The bound
// is derived and never written in, and the count of runs it is read from is steered by the part, as a walk. Runs of
// held asks are put unbound, and the bound is the largest of every run put, plus their spread, plus one step of the
// clock, the least the clock can tell apart. Each step of the walk puts as many runs again, each read against the
// bound the record so far gives, and reads the bound again over the doubled record. The walk ends on the first step
// whose runs all land under the bound, and only where that step is as long as the reach the trace leans on it for:
// every side still to be asked. A short step that lands under the bound says nothing about a longer reach, and a run
// the part stalls lands in the record before the bound is taken. There is no count the walk stops at.
//
// The trace is put in sections, one a cycle. Before each cycle a held run is put for every side the cycle asks, each
// read against the bound. Where every one lands under it, the bound still speaks for the part and the cycle is put.
// Where one lands past it, the part has moved since the bound was read, and the walk takes up the same record again
// for the reach still ahead before the cycle is put.
//
// How far the bound swings is kept, section by section and in sum. The bound only grows, since a run can raise the
// largest or lower the least and never the reverse. Its whole swing is the steer cost, how hard the part pulled on
// the clock while the trace was put, and a section that swings where the sections before it did not marks work the
// part did and did not name: an interrupt, a stall, another process on the core. The least held run is the base
// cost, and the base cost plus the steer cost is the cost indicator. Every figure is in the clock word's own counts,
// and every section's swing is written into the trace as a line gnascor_read.py passes over.
//
// A run that holds and costs past the bound is written PAST_BOUND. The four baseline cycles gnascor_read.py reads its
// edge from are written at the head of the trace, from the first eight runs.
