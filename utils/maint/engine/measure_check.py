"""What a cost reading resolves and what it cannot, measured instead of argued.

    python utils/maint/engine/measure_check.py [--trials N]

The noisy half of the query protocol. Six checks, each one isolating a claim chain slicing rests
on. Every number below is produced by the run and none is quoted from anywhere.

    1  slicing a chain by adjacent cuts, against the noise floor
    2  how far repetition carries check 1, steered: a level that orders no more pairs ends it
    3  permuted subsets against the prefix ladder at one measurement budget
    4  one ask per link against a known order of covering asks
    5  a known order against a drawn one, where a bad draw has nowhere to hide
    6  whether the costs add, what notices when they do not, and what repairs it

Everything here is about speed and nothing here reaches a correctness result.
`utils/maint/engine/order_check.py` holds the noiseless half as checks 7 through 12, and the separation
between the two files is the separation the two stages buy.

EVERY VALUE IS THREE INTEGERS: a quotient, a remainder and a divisor, the value q + r/d with
0 <= r < d. Integer adds and integer division move them, and every operation carries its remainder
forward. Nothing is rounded at any width. No floating point value is formed anywhere here. The
noise is a sum of fair coins, every solve is fraction-free integer elimination, and a spread is held
as its square. No root is taken. Each figure prints its quotient and its remainder over its
divisor, and every figure is written in full to build/engine/measure_check.tsv.

THE UNIT HERE IS THE FLOOR. Every cost is quoted in floors, and the noise's square is one floor
squared by construction. No absolute figure is written in. The plan's own ratio sets the rest:
one operation sits under the floor, and a chain of fifteen clears it.
