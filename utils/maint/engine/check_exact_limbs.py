# Check the C limb arithmetic against python integers, which know nothing about limbs.
#
#   python utils/maint/engine/check_exact_limbs.py                  build/engine_c/bench_exact is run
#   python utils/maint/engine/check_exact_limbs.py <rows.txt>       rows already captured are read
#
# WHY THE CHECK IS NOT INSIDE THE C
#
# A library cannot be its own oracle. A second routine in bench_exact.c saying what an addition
# should come to would carry whatever the author believed about the answer, and it would agree with
# the first routine forever, including on the days both are wrong.
#
# A python integer is arbitrary precision and is implemented by somebody else. It has no fixed
# width, no limb, no carry the author of exact_integer_*.c wrote, and no shared line of code. Where the
# two disagree the disagreement is real.
#
# WHAT THIS CHECK CANNOT SEE
#
# Both sides read one contract, and that contract is exact_integer.h. Agreement here is evidence the
# contract is unambiguous and that two implementations read it the same way. It is not evidence
# that either reading matches a deposit.
#
# A CIF, or any third format, could define decimal text differently from the way this header does.
# Both arms would then be wrong together and every row below would still come back green. That
# failure is invisible from here and the only thing that finds it is a published number: the
# crystallography oracle compares a recovered period against a cell edge somebody else measured,
# That check has an answer from outside this tree, and this one does not.
#
# WHAT IS BEING COMPARED
#
# The C prints a sign, how many limbs the value uses, and those limbs in hex, least significant
# first. This reassembles that into an integer and compares against the same operation done
# directly. It also checks the errors: a value too wide for the fixed width has to come back
# errored, since a fixed width is the only bound this representation carries and a silent wrap is
# the worst failure available to it.
#
# The same rows are read at every width a build selects, 1 limb to 32768. The width comes from the
# first row the driver prints and never from the header text, since the build that produced the
# rows may have set it.

# The subject built to overrun the width carries 315654 digits at 32768 limbs, and python errors instead of
