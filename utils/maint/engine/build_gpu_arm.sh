#   --limbs N       exact width in 32 bit limbs, a power of two from 1 to 32768 (default: the
#                   header's 128). exact_integer.h errors on any other value at compile time.
#   --digits N      decimal digit floor, needed where the width is below 4096 bits
#   --positions N   positions in the planted run (default: the bench's 4096). At 32768 limbs one
#                   position is 128 KiB on the host and twice that on the device.

# nvcc needs a host compiler and on Windows that host compiler is MSVC, never MinGW. The rest of
# this tree builds with MinGW, and MinGW objects do not link against MSVC objects. The GPU arm
# gets its own build and does not join the CMake one. Everything it needs is compiled here by the
# same host compiler nvcc is driving. That keeps the ABI consistent inside this binary.
#
# Architectures default to the one this machine carries. Naming others compiles for them as well.
# That is how an architecture nobody here owns is checked: the code has to compile and the assembler
# has to accept it for that target, and only running it is left unverified.

# the stale one and reported a device engine that "agreed" with the portable engine at 1.01x. It
# agreed because it WAS the portable engine, carrying no CUDA at all, and the ratio wandering
# between 1.01x and 1.14x across runs was two runs of identical code.
