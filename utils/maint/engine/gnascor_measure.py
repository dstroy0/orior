"""Two readings of the gnascor state machine: what a label keeps of its transition, and what repeats on the host.

    python utils/maint/engine/gnascor_measure.py --labels
    python utils/maint/engine/gnascor_measure.py --repeat <runs>

--labels counts, in bits, how much of a transition a label leaves recoverable. A transition is its pair, the
state left and the state reached. Each pair the tables in src/c/transpiler/gnascor.md name is put through every
situation gnascor_read.py decides a label in, every pair weighted alike and every situation alike within it. The
reading is the conditional entropy of the pair given what a branch reads, H(pair | label), taken four ways:

    the tables alone     one name a cell, as the tables print it, over every named cell of the first table
    a bare label         the one label gnascor_read.py decides in the situation
    the clock's label    the same, with a sync passage written as its fuzz+ and fizz+ labels
    a gray trip's state  the same, with fuzz into gray carrying the state left and fizz out of it the state reached

H(pair) less H(pair | label) is the part of the transition the label keeps.

--repeat puts gnascor_scenario.txt to the host as real asks the given number of times, through the
gnascor_trace program utils/maint/engine/chain_check.sh builds, and reads every trace back. It reports how many
cycles read as the scenario implies, how many asks the scenario holds came in past the bound their own run
derived, how many both-held cycles read busy in place of dual, how many sides of those cycles come in past the
busy edge alone and both at once against the count two independent sides would give, how many distinct coherence
clocks the runs print, and the spread of the bound each run derives. A held ask past its bound is a spurious timeout: the bound is
estimated from a finite sample of the host's costs, and the host can still exceed it. The traces are written
under build/engine/repeat/.

Nothing here is copied from the tables: they are read out of gnascor.md each run, as gnascor_read.py reads them.
