"""The rules instead of the frequencies: which transitions are possible and which are forbidden.

Every earlier reading of the influence web here was a distribution - how often an input at one
position reached an output at another. That counts pieces. A language is not its letter frequencies;
it is what may follow what, and the interesting entries are the ones that never occur at all.

So this reads the SUPPORT. For a single-bit input difference, which output positions are ever moved
and which are never moved, at each depth. A position that is never moved after many excitations is
not rare - it is forbidden, and a forbidden transition is a hard constraint on the machine instead
of a statistical lean.

WHY FORBIDDEN IS WORTH MORE THAN RARE

A rare transition needs a probability and a null and an argument. A forbidden one needs none of
those: it either happened or it did not, and if a transition cannot occur then any trajectory
requiring it is ruled out completely. That makes impossible differentials a different kind
of tool from the statistical ones, and it is the reading a frequency table cannot give.

THE WINDOW CLOSES FAST

At depth one almost everything is forbidden. By depth six or so the support fills, every position
becomes reachable from every other, and the grammar stops constraining anything. Where it closes IS
the measurement: it says how many rounds the machine needs before it can say anything to anything.
