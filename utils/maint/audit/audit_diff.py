"""Reports which bench outputs differ between optimization arms, ignoring wall clock.

A bench built at -O0 and at -O2 runs at different speeds. Any line reporting elapsed time or a
rate differs between arms for a reason that has nothing to do with arithmetic. Comparing whole
files marks almost every bench as compiler-dependent and the finding is worthless.

The question is whether a *measured* number moved. This drops timing lines and then compares, and
prints the surviving differences in full so that each one is judged on what it says and not on
a hash.

Usage: python utils/maint/audit/audit_diff.py <audit directory>
