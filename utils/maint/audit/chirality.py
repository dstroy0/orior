"""A counter-rotating arm: read the same state through both handednesses and difference them.

The golden placement winds one way. Index k sits at height 1 - 2(k + 0.5)/n and longitude k gamma.
The arm is a helix with a handedness, and every reading taken through it carries that
handedness. A second arm winding the other way - longitude MINUS k gamma, same heights - reads the
same state through the mirror.

If the object has no chirality the two readings are mirror images with identical statistics, and
their difference is zero up to the format. Any difference is handedness in the data.

WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO LOOK

SHA-256 is chiral by construction and it is not subtle about it. Every rotation in the round
function turns the same way:

    Sigma0 = ROTR2  xor ROTR13 xor ROTR22
    Sigma1 = ROTR6  xor ROTR11 xor ROTR25

Six rotations, all rightward, no leftward rotation anywhere in the design. The message schedule's
spreads are the same. So the function has a handedness in its transport, and the question is whether
that handedness survives into the boundary reading or is destroyed by the mixing.

Torsion is the statistic that can answer it, because torsion is itself chiral: it measures twist,
and twist has a sign. Deflection cannot - it is a magnitude and mirror-blind by construction, and that
makes it the internal control. A reading where deflection matches and torsion differs is chirality;
one where both differ is a bug in the placement.
