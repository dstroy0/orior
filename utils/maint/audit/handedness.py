"""Counter-rotate the FUNCTION: SHA-256 against itself with every rotation reversed.

The mirror-arm test could not answer this. Reflecting a point set negates every longitude, which
conjugates every coefficient, which negates every phase - for any data at all. The answer was fixed
by geometry before SHA was consulted, and it came back at 1e-16, which is float64's floor and not a
fact about hashing.

The handedness that could matter is in the function. SHA-256 turns one way, six times, and never the
other:

    Sigma0 = ROTR2  xor ROTR13 xor ROTR22        on the a chain
    Sigma1 = ROTR6  xor ROTR11 xor ROTR25        on the e chain
    sigma0 = ROTR7  xor ROTR18 xor SHR3          in the schedule
    sigma1 = ROTR17 xor ROTR19 xor SHR10         in the schedule

Replacing every ROTR with a ROTL of the same amount gives a function with identical structure and
opposite handedness. Everything else - the constants, the additions, the nonlinear terms, the round
count - is untouched. So the two differ in exactly one property and can be compared.

WHAT EACH OUTCOME MEANS

    same statistics    handedness is cosmetic. The rotation amounts matter, their direction does
                       not, and the design could have gone either way.
    different          the direction matters, and a reading that is mirror-blind by
                       construction has been discarding something real.

The shifts are left alone. SHR is not a rotation and has no mirror that preserves the
structure. Reversing it would change the function in a second way and spoil the comparison.
