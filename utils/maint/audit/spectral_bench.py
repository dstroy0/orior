"""Spectral bench: what the reading keeps when the observer moves, and what it only appears to keep.

A previous framing here separated the per-degree power from the phases and treated them as
independent - magnitude invariant, phase observer-dependent. That split is clean only on the
one-parameter subgroup of rotations about the reading axis, where

    a_lm  ->  a_lm times e^(-i m alpha)

is a pure phase shift and every per-order magnitude survives untouched. Under a GENERAL rotation it
is false: the coefficients mix,

    a_lm  ->  sum over m' of D^l_(m'm)(R) times a_lm'

so magnitude redistributes across orders inside a degree, and only the SUM of squared magnitudes
over m is preserved. Reporting that sum and calling it the invariant hides the mixing, because
summing over m is the operation that makes the mixing invisible.

So this bench reports both, side by side, and never one without the other:

    P_l           sum over m of |a_lm|^2, which must not move under any rotation
    the spread    how far the individual |a_lm| move within the degree, which must

A reading where both are flat is not measuring general rotations - it is sweeping the axis and
calling it a sweep. A reading where P_l moves is a reading that does not realize the Wigner
structure, at that rank or that placement.
