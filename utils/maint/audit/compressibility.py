"""The axis every other test in this tree misses: algorithmic structure instead of distribution.

Everything else here is statistical. Uniform shares, flat autocorrelation, full algebraic degree, no
co-variation between positions. The digits of pi pass every one of those tests, and the digits of pi
compress to about a kilobyte. So passing them establishes nothing about whether a sequence has a
short generating program, and that is the property that would matter.

    a sequence can be perfectly uniform and perfectly compressible at the same time

This runs the other axis. Three sequences are compared under identical treatment:

    sha       leading bits of SHA-256 over consecutive nonces, the thing mining searches
    pi        hexadecimal digits of pi, which HAVE a short program by construction
    random    the operating system's entropy source, which by assumption has none

The pi arm is the point. It is the positive control for the thing being hunted: a sequence known to
have a kilobyte program. If the instrument cannot separate pi from random, then it cannot separate
SHA from random either, and saying so is the result.

WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DO

Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable. No tool decides this. A compressor gives an UPPER bound:
if it compresses, structure exists. Failing to compress proves nothing, because the compressor is
looking for repetition and a generating program is not repetition. That asymmetry is the honest
limit and the pi arm measures it directly instead of leaving it as a caveat.
