"""Which scan finds which structure: the harmonic expansion against three rivals, on planted data.

The claim under test is that spherical harmonics are the best sniffer for deciding where to point an
expensive measurement. That is testable instead of arguable: plant structures whose nature is known,
run every scan on each, and see which finds what.

Four structures, chosen so they are NOT all of one kind:

    cap         a region of the sphere over-lit. Spatial, and the harmonic's home ground.
    word        one 32-bit state word biased. Aligned to SHA's own structure, not to the sphere's.
    stride      every seventh bit index lit. Periodic in index, which the placement scatters.
    parity      bits chosen so that a fixed parity is forced. Purely algebraic - no bit is individually
                biased, no region is over-lit, and nothing about it is spatial.

Four scans:

    harmonic    per-degree power, against a popcount-matched null
    shares      the 256 individual bit shares, loudest against its own max-of-256 bar
    walsh       the loudest parity correlation over a mask set, which is a linear functional in
                bit space instead of on the sphere
    runs        adjacent-index agreement, which sees clumping in index order

A scan that finds everything would be the answer. The expected result is that each finds its own
kind, which would mean "best sniffer" is not a property a single transform can have.
