# Sweeps the window phase, which no measurement in this tree has ever varied.
#
# From the symbol width posit in orior: a detector is not told where the units begin, and a
# slice of the right width at the wrong offset splits every unit across two symbols. Every window
# bench_renyi reads is byte aligned. Seven of the eight possible alignments have never been
# looked at, at any width. Structure sitting at an offset of one to seven bits would be split at
# every window in every run recorded so far and would be invisible to all of them.
#
# The sweep is affordable at a reduced domain because the resolution of a deficit ratio depends on
# the bin count and not on the domain size: the chi-square statistic behind it has variance twice
# its degrees of freedom. One window resolves its deficit to sqrt(2/(r-1)) whatever the domain.
# A 2^28 run is therefore exactly as sensitive to a phase difference as a 2^32 run and costs a
# sixteenth as much, and eight of them together cost half of one full run.
#
# The splitmix control runs at every phase as well. A pseudorandom function has no preferred
# alignment. Its spread across phases is the floor below which a difference between phases on
# the real function means nothing.
