"""Combs the survey arms: pooled depth, and the agreement between them.

Eight arms each survey the same nonce range under a different header. Pooling them tightens the
estimate as the square root of the total. More of anything buys that. The agreement
between them buys something else, and it is the reason to run arms instead of one longer arm:

    a bias in the construction pushes EVERY arm the same way
    a bias in one header pushes one arm and leaves the rest alone
    noise pushes each arm independently

So the sign of a position's deviation, read across arms, separates the three. Under the null each
arm's sign is a fair coin. All eight agreeing has probability two in two hundred fifty six, and
over 256 positions chance alone delivers about two such positions. That is the bar, and it is
computed instead of chosen.

Every comparison is integer. A position set c times out of N deviates by 2c - N exactly, pooling is
addition, and testing against k standard errors is (sum of deviations) squared against k squared
times (sum of N). Nothing divides and nothing takes a root.
