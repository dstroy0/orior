"""Trace one flipped bit through every interior value as well as to the boundary.

Every other measurement in this tree reads the digest: the state after N rounds, the
boundary of the computation. That is the right shape for a physical system, where the interior
cannot be reached and has to be inferred from what escapes. It is the wrong shape here, because
nothing about this interior is hidden.

The whole machine is visible at every instant:

    w[t]                the sixty-four schedule words as they are produced
    a through h         the eight state words after every round
    s1, ch, t1          the three values built on the e chain inside a round
    s0, maj, t2         the three built on the a chain

A single flipped input bit can be followed through all of it - where it arrives, in what order,
by which of the two chains, and how far it has spread at each point. A boundary reading gives one
number per round; this gives the whole path.

WHAT THE PATH ANSWERS THAT THE BOUNDARY CANNOT

The decay measurement found the spread ACROSS input bits peaking near round ten and collapsing at
both ends, which is a transient. A boundary reading cannot say whether that is one path being slow
or many paths arriving at different times, because it only sees the sum. The interior separates
them: the influence is either sitting in a particular word or it is not.
