"""Watches a running miner against calibrated models instead of guessed thresholds.

Every miner watchdog sets its alarms by judgment - warn under so many megahashes, complain after so
many seconds without a share - and every one of those numbers is somebody's guess. The quantities
being watched here have known distributions. The thresholds can be computed instead.

Four checks, each with its floor derived from the process instead of chosen:

  anchor rate     the anchor fires when one 32-bit word lands on zero. Survivors are Poisson
                  with mean hashes / 2^32. That makes the ratio the log already prints testable:
                  a deficit means the kernel is missing survivors, which is a CORRECTNESS fault
                  and not a performance one. This is the most valuable check here because a miner
                  that quietly computes the wrong thing looks exactly like one that is working.
  hashrate drift  the instantaneous rate wanders by timing jitter alone, and that spread is stable
                  on healthy hardware. A widening spread is thermal throttling before the mean has
                  moved far enough to notice.
  share arrivals  shares are Poisson at the pool's share difficulty. The gaps are exponential
                  with a known mean. A drought is only meaningful against that mean, and the
                  probability of a drought this long is computable instead of alarming.
  job cadence     a pool sends work on its own rhythm. The gaps are what they are, and the alarm
                  belongs at a quantile of the observed distribution instead of at a round number.
