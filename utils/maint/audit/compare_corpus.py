"""Differences the clean survey against the contaminated chain, position by position.

The survey hashes synthetic headers on the device and counts every output bit. Nothing selects the
results and no operator touches them. It is the construction's own distribution measured to a
depth no chain could reach. The chain corpus is the same function's output contaminated twice over:
every digest was SELECTED for sitting below a target, and every one was produced by a machine whose
conventions we spent the night measuring.

Having both makes a subtraction possible that neither supports alone.

THE TRAP

A real block's digest carries seventy-odd leading zeros by construction. Comparing those positions
against the survey measures the difficulty rule, not the miners, and would report a large and
entirely uninteresting difference. So the leading run is excluded and the question is asked only of
the positions past it:

    conditioning on the top k bits being zero leaves the remaining 256 - k uniform

The theory says that, it is not obvious, and a selected sample lets you
check it. If tilt reaches past the zero run it shows here and nowhere else.

THE FLOOR

The survey's precision is irrelevant to the comparison. A few thousand real digests give a standard
error near one over twice the square root of that count, which is four parts in a thousand. The
chain side sets the floor and the survey side is exact by comparison. The bar is the loudest of the
positions tested, not a single position's, and it is drawn from the same binomial.
