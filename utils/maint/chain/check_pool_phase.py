"""Do pools disagree about the hour, or does the statistic disagree with itself?

An earlier version of this test compared each pool's peak-minus-trough against two Poisson floors
and reported that eight pools cleared it and their troughs spanned twenty hours. Both halves of that
were artifacts.

Peak minus trough is a maximum minus a minimum over twenty-four bins, and that spans three and a
half to four and a half standard deviations for pure noise, by construction. A bar set at two, or
even at four, is at or below what chance produces. Every pool clears it. And eight trough hours
drawn uniformly from twenty-four span about nineteen hours on average. A twenty hour spread is
the expected result of no signal at all instead of evidence against it.

The correct question is asked here in two stages, each against a null built at that pool's own
sample size:

  is the pool non-uniform     chi-square on its own 24 hourly counts, against a multinomial null
                              drawn at that pool's n. Only pools that clear this have a phase.
  do the phases differ        for the pools that clear, whether their trough hours are further
                              apart than the same number of uniform draws would be

The second stage is only meaningful on pools that pass the first. That is the step the earlier
version skipped.
