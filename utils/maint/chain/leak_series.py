"""The collision-entropy leak as a time series: its mean, its fluctuation, and its trend.

A single number for the leak hides the thing worth knowing. Conventions are set by software, and
software is deployed, updated and retired. The leak has no reason to hold still. Measured in
sliding windows it has three separable parts, and they answer different questions:

  mean          what the network's conventions cost on average. That is the number that belongs
                in a summary
  fluctuation   how much a window-sized sample wanders. The floor on this is known instead of
                estimated: a window of W blocks manufactures a deficit near log2(1 + (n-1)/W)
                on its own. Anything beyond that is real movement
  trend         whether the mean is going anywhere. A convention spreading or dying shows here and
                nowhere else, and it is the part a single number cannot carry

PER HASH

A block is the expected outcome of difficulty times 2^32 hashes. The leak per block divided by
that is the leak per hash. It is a very small number and it is the honest intensive quantity: the
network pays this much collision entropy for every hash it computes, and it is paid whether
anybody is reading.
