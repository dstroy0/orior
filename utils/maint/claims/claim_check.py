# Hold every public claim against the theory, as the engine holds the device against the host.
#
#   python utils/maint/claims/claim_check.py [--all] [--strict] [<surface> ...]
#
# A surface is a page a reader meets first: README.md, every page under docs/, the README of
# theory/, and the abstract of every research paper. The theory is every other .tex and .md file
# under theory/. With no surface named, all of them are read.
#
# The theory takes a result back in its own words, and a block that holds one of the words in MARK
# is marked. A block is a paragraph, a list item, or one row of a table. A heading does not mark the
# blocks under it: a section headed with one of those words holds the corrected statement beside the
# one it replaced. The theory keeps the claim it took back beside the block that takes it back. A
# claim that was taken back is found in a marked block and usually in one that is not marked as well.
#
# Three kinds of key are read off each block of a surface and of the theory, after number words are
# read as numbers and the commas inside a number are dropped:
#
#   number   four or more digits, a decimal point, or a percent sign
#   pair     N of M, N of the M, N out of M, or N/M
#   phrase   a number beside a word of four or more letters
#
# A block of the theory that holds the key, where it and the statement share three or more words, is
# on the same subject, and it weighs as many as the words the two share. A block that is not marked
# counts as marked where a marked block further down the same file holds the same key and the two
# share three words. Each key on a surface gets one answer from the theory:
#
#   taken back   the marked blocks weigh as much as the rest, or more
#   both         the marked blocks weigh a third of the whole or more
#   nowhere      the theory does not hold it at all; numbers and pairs only, since a phrase alone
#                is too loose to stand for a claim
#   held         anything else; shown with --all
#
# A surface block that is itself marked, or that says a claim was killed, is telling the reader
# about the take back, and its keys are never answered taken back or both.
#
# taken back and both end the run with 1, and with --strict so does nowhere. A finding a person has
# read and found sound goes in claims_read.tsv beside this file, one row of surface, key, answer and
# why; the row quiets that finding and no other, and when the claim or the theory changes the
# answer, the row stops matching and the finding comes back.
