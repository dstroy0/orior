"""Specific Emitter Identification: does the per-round modulation carry the round constants?

The common mode of the residue fold decrements by almost exactly 2048 sigmas per round. Almost is
the interesting part. Across rounds 10 to 16 the decrements are 2047.1, 2048.4, 2047.7, 2050.5,
2048.5 and 2046.3 - a scatter near 1.5 where the fold's own measurement error is nearer 0.25.

Rounds differ in exactly one thing. The round function is identical at every depth; only the round
constant K_t changes, and the schedule word. So if that modulation is larger than noise it has to
be carried by K_t, and this is the electronic-warfare question asked literally: an emitter is
identified not by its intended signal but by the unintentional modulation its hardware imposes.

Two things are needed and both are checked here. First, whether the scatter is real - which is
settled by comparing it to the error the fold actually has, estimated from the deep rounds where
there is no signal at all. Second, whether it correlates with anything about K_t.

    python utils/maint/radar/sei_round_constants.py

The constants are read from the tree and never retyped, because a transcription error here would
manufacture exactly the correlation being looked for.
