"""Reads the compositional assay: does removing a sub-function remove its residues?

A radar with a library of known materials can say what an unknown return is made of. Here the
library does not have to be collected, because the variants can be built: the same residue spectrum
is taken from SHA-256 with one sub-function shorted out at a time, and what disappears says which
channel that sub-function was carrying.

The predictions were written into src/engine/c/sha256/bench/bench_sac.cu before the run:

    without Sigma1     classes 6, 11 and 25 go
    without Sigma0     classes 2, 13 and 22 go, and they were weak already
    without addition   class 31 goes, because -1 mod 32 is the carry
    without Choose     a large change, Choose being in T1
    without Majority   little change, Majority being in T2

A removed rotation whose residue still stands would refute the reading of the spectrum outright,
and that comparison is the point of running it.
