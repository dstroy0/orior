"""A radar receive chain applied to the residue spectrum.

The problem this fixes is one the earlier reading created for itself. The residue fold carries a
large offset shared by every class - incomplete avalanche and the message-schedule light cone, both
of which are independent of the output bit - and a detector that does not remove it reports the
offset instead of the target. Subtracting a plain mean across classes is the crude fix; the
principled one is what radar does with clutter, and it comes with statistics.

Four stages, in the order a receiver applies them:

  clutter map      what every class shares, estimated per round and removed
  OS-CFAR          the background under a cell estimated from its neighbors by an order
                   statistic. Other targets sitting in the training cells cannot mask it.
                   The earlier reading used the plain scatter of the other 31 classes, which
                   included 6, 11, 25 and 31 - all real targets - and inflated its own noise floor
  coherent sum     the signature is constant across rounds 6 to 16. Integrating there gains
                   sqrt(11) on it and nothing on noise
  matched filter   the transmitted waveform is known a priori, because it is the round function's
                   own transport: the diagonal, the carry, and the two Sigma functions' rotation
                   amounts. Projecting onto it costs no multiple-comparison penalty at all, since
                   nothing was chosen after looking
