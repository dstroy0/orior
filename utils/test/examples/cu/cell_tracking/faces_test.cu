// (3, 4, 5); frame 1, drifted (1, 1, 1) onto, t (0, 0, 0), p (0, 2, 2), s (1, 1, 1), q (2, 0, 2) and r (2, 2, 0); frame

// (0, 0, 1) onto, e (0, 0, 0) and c' (1, 1, 3). a links to t and c to c'; p to u is in the gate and not chosen. So p,
// q and r start predicted back to -1 on z, y and x and enter, s to 0 on each and does not, and t, predicted back past
// three low faces, has its link in and is no start; u, v and w start predicted back to the extent on z, y and x and
// enter, and x to the extent less 1 on each and does not; c starts carried back by its link's motion too, past x's low
// face, which without the motion it would not cross, and enters; e starts past x's low face at the last frame and
// enters. b, p, q, w, x, v and u end with their predictions past a face and leave; r ends predicted at 0 on x, s at
// the extent less 1 on each, t inside, and none leaves; c's prediction lies past a face, but it has its link out and
// does not end. a's and b's .shape faces ride at bit 24. still is 1 frame in a 1 x 2 x 3 view, its two points first
// and last at once, one with all six .shape faces; empty is a sample of no frames. The three run as one set and the
// report is checked against the hand's counts. Then each of thirteen broken samples, alone in its set, errors and
// leaves no .faces, a stale one taken away: a back-prediction past 32 bits, an outside flag on a prediction inside the
// view, a .drift of other frames, a .drift with a word past its last frame, a .shape of the wrong limbs, a .shape
// counting other points, a .shape face past the six, no .shape, a .links of another view, two chosen links out of one
// point, a pair record whose chosen count is not its gate's, a .links cut short (each a copy of walk), and a view past
// 2^31 - 1 voxels; and beside a good still, which writes, the first of them makes the set error. Malformed requests
