# numbers alone is written into cubins of its own, held to cubin_safe, run on the part through interface_sass_run
# over every case at once, and read back against each relation into interface_sass_writings.md. Every arrangement of
# the part's .kdm is then written node by node from the writings found, run and read back into
# interface_sass_chains.md. Last, the cases the descent places for each relation (gate_descent) are put to the part
# over every arrangement the descent ran over, and the part's verdicts held to the descent's in
# interface_sass_descent.md. sass.krs's forms for the word web's words are held to the writings found in
