// query_ask_check.c: the query protocol's ask, held to what it says on addresses whose answers are known
//
// Each check puts an ask to an address whose state the test set itself, or to one a reader can name as a counter,
// and holds the bit, the kind and the cost to what that address has to answer:
//
//   holds      memory the test owns gives back both words it is put, and is left as it was found
//   equals     a word the test wrote reads as that word, and as no other
//   advances   a word nothing writes does not advance
//   bound      a bound with no clock reads 0 past the bound, and an unbound ask carries its kind
//   clock      a counter named by the platform advances under the ADVANCES qualifier, and an ask clocked on it
//              returns a cost that a bound below it fails and a bound above it passes
//
// Only the counter sits at an address the test does not own. On Windows every process can read the
// interrupt time the kernel keeps at 0x7FFE0008 with a plain load and no call: the test forms its question there,
// and the protocol's answer is checked against the fact that the word counts. A platform that names no such address
// to the test skips the clock checks and says so.
