//
// gnascor names a steady lead and a steady rite apart, core and surv. lead and rite are the sign of the signed
// difference between two branches at a link, and the two names are one state seen from either side unless the side
// itself leaves a mark. This asks the part whether it does. Two branches doing the same work, seven links each, are
// put through the known order one after the other, the one asked first changing from trial to trial, and every
// link's solved cost read against the other branch's. If asking first leaves no mark, the first branch reads dearer
// in as many trials as the second does.
//
// Every branch is solved in exact integers, one pass a trial, and two branches compare at a link by cross-multiplying
// their exact costs. Nothing is summed and nothing is rounded. A trial reads first-dearer where the branch asked first
// is dearer at more of its seven links than not, and counts once: a slow pass lands on every link of the branch it
// falls in, and counting links apart would count one slow pass seven times. The sides are read apart where the trials
// lean past twice their own spread: (2·first - trials)² > 4·trials.
//
// One claim is held. Two branches that do not do the same work, the second reading 512 more times at every link,
// read the first as cheaper at every link, whichever side it is asked from: the sign follows the cost and not the
// side. Its trials are a descent: a link stands while its count leans past twice its spread neither way, and the
// trials end the first trial nothing stands, or at CHECK_TRIALS_MOST. Whether the side leaves a mark is printed and
// not held, since that is the part's to say. Its trials are not cut short where the count first leans: two branches
// doing the same work give a count that leans by chance at some trial more often than the spread says. It is read on
// the whole record, at CHECK_TRIALS_MOST. The run size is steered by the part, as query_descent.h states.
