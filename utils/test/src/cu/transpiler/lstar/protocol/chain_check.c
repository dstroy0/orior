// chain_check.c: how much of a relation the ladder's own cases decide
//
// A ladder climbs by putting a few small words and reading what comes back. This builds each relation's chains
// twice: once against those cases alone, and once against the relation on words the cases do not carry. The gap is
// the count of arrangements the cases let through that are not the relation at all - right about the words they
// were fitted to and wrong about the rest.
//
// That gap is the reading this exists for. It is how many answers a target can give before an answer means
// anything, and a case added to the ladder is worth adding exactly insofar as it closes it.
