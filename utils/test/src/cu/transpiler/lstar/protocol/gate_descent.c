// gate_descent.c: the gate run as the engine's own sift descent, against every arrangement asked every case
//
// The gate decides which arrangements hold a relation. Here it is the descent orior already runs over any
// field it can ask equality of. Each arrangement chain_build keeps against a relation's ladder cases is an
// alignment, the needle is those cases and then the words chain_build's own sweep puts, and the oracle answers
// whether an arrangement gives a case the word the relation gives it.
//
// Three readings, each against a ground truth that does not depend on the descent:
//
//   survivors   what the descent leaves standing, verified case by case, equals what every arrangement asked every
//               case leaves standing, and both equal what chain_build keeps with its sweep on
//   depth       a descent with the destroy rule off leaves the same count as one with it on. Stopping where the best
//               case prunes nothing gives up nothing, and this holds the descent to that claim
//   cases       the cases the descent places, which are the ones that decide the relation
//   asks        how many asks a target takes for every arrangement against those cases, by what one answer carries
//
// The planning reads every case against every survivor at each level. That is the price of choosing well, and it is
// paid on this host against arithmetic every system that computes agrees about. A target is asked only the cases
// the descent placed.
