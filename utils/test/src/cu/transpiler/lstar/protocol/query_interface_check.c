// Address 0 is mapped in no process: a read there ends the asker on every host, and the walk reads that ending as
// the address's answer and goes on. On Windows the kernel keeps a page at 0x7FFE0000 that every process reads and
// none may write. A put there ends the asker, a read answers, and two of its words are counters: the interrupt time
// at 0x8 and the system time at 0x14, each the low word of a count in hundred nanoseconds. That layout is the answer
// key here and is never read by the walk: the walk asks every word of the page's head whether it advances, and the
// check holds what came back to the key.
