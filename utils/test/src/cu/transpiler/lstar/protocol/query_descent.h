// query_descent.h: the run size and the count of passes of a known order, steered by the part, for the checks that put
// the order to the host
//
// NO COUNT OF PASSES AND NO RUN SIZE IS SET HERE. Both are steered, the way the engine's descent steers its probes.
// Each pass is a level: its bit for a pair of neighboring links is 1 where the later link reads dearer. A pair stands
// while its count over every pass put so far leans past twice its own spread neither way, and the descent ends the
// first pass nothing stands, or at QUERY_DESCENT_PASSES_MOST, the bound it is held to before it starts. A pair is read
// on its whole record at every pass and is never closed early: the reads carry noise, and a count that leans at a few
// passes can stop leaning at more. The run size is the candidate the descent is steered over. Every size is read, and
// the one that leaves the fewest pairs standing, then spends the fewest puts, is kept, a tie going to the shorter. A
// size stops once it has spent the puts the best so far needed with a pair still standing, since past that it cannot
// do better.
