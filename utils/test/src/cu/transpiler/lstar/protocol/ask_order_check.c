// ask_order_check.c: the known order of asks, held to its exact claims at every size it covers
//
// The exact claims are checked over the whole of every set they are about, and the count is printed:
//
//   inverse     4 S' - 2 J times S is (links + 1) times the identity, entry by entry

//   solve       costs built from integer link costs solve back to (links + 1) times each link, at any pass count
//   overhead    a fixed cost on every ask moves every link by the same amount
//   contention  a cost that grows with the square of the count an ask covers does the same
//   refusal     a link count no known order covers is refused, and the solve writes nothing
//   sweep       the sweep's asks cover one link, half plus one and every link, in turn
//
// The contention read is a test on noisy costs and is measured and not proved: costs drawn in integers around an
// overhead, pairs of links contending by an amount drawn per pair, and the rate the read finds contention at each
// amount, the rate at none being its false alarms.
