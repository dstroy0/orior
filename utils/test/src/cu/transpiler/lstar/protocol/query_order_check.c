//
// Seven links, each an ask at a word the test owns and nothing writes: QUERY_ADVANCES, which reads the word until it
// moves or its turns run out. A still word never moves, and link k reads it 1 + 64·k times: the work each link
// does is known and the links are far apart in it. One access against five is not far apart: an ask's own overhead is
// larger than four reads, and the order put over QUERY_HOLDS against QUERY_EQUALS does not tell them apart.
//
// The clock is not named to the order: the test asks every word of the page every Windows process shares whether it
// advances, and takes the first that does. The clock turns over now and then, and a run is read on it finely by
// counting reads of the clock between turns, its cost the exact rational that gives. The known order is then put, every
// pass is solved on its own in exact integers, and every link has to come out dearer than the link before it, past
// twice the spread. That is the claim held here: the solve, run on the part's own clock with nothing rounded and
// nothing summed away, orders links by the work they do.
//
// The run size and the count of passes are steered by the part, as query_descent.h states. The claim is read on the
// record of the size kept: every pair has to lean dearer on one same pass, over every pass put at that size.
