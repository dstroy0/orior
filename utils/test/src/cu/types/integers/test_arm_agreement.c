/**
 * @file test_arm_agreement.c
 * @brief Grades every arm against the naive one at the lengths that bound the input, and at none.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 * @date 2026-09-16
 *
 * @note The kernel's own contract is that every arm is sound. No arm can lose a true occurrence
 *       and every arm must return what the naive one returns. This driver asks that question at the
 *       lengths nobody searches with: none, one, and two. A needle of one byte puts all four anchors
 *       on the same offset, and a needle of no bytes has no offset to put them on at all.
 *
 * @note It links the kernel instead of restating it. A grader holding its own copy of the function
 *       it grades keeps passing forever after somebody repairs the original, the one way a
 *       test can be worse than no test.
 *
 * @warning This is a negative control and it is expected to FAIL before the repair it accompanies.
 *          On a kernel where choose_offsets clamps a zero length needle to needle_len - 1u, that
 *          expression wraps to SIZE_MAX on size_t and the arms read far outside both pointers. The
 *          run may crash and not print a row, and a crash here is the finding.
