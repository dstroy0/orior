// The sum across lanes. cycle_record_sum reads a field of every record in device memory and returns, for each run of
// consecutive records, their exact sum as two's complement: each 32-bit limb summed into 64 bits by the records of a
// thread and one atomic add a run, the negative fields counted beside, and the carries and the sign taken on the host.
// cycle_record_sum_host adds the same records in order, each sign-extended. The two must agree word for word, and both
// must equal closed forms:
// - a record program's lane number l over 2^22 lanes: sum l = L(L - 1) / 2, sum -l, sum l^2 = (L - 1) L (2L - 1) / 6,
//   which passes 2^64, and sum -l^2, over all the lanes and over runs of 2^16, each run its own closed form;
// - random records of nine limbs, fields one bit wide, across two limbs, a whole limb, two hundred bits and the whole
//   record, over runs of 1, 3, 1024 and every record;
// - every field at its most negative and at its most positive, the sums' two ends.
// A request whose sums cannot hold the run's total, whose count is not a whole number of runs, or whose run passes
// 2^32 records errors on both routes before a record is read. The test is one job on the device's tessera daemon.
