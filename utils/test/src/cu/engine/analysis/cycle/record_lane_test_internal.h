//
// The lane's own number as a register, and the latch (vertical_time_compression.md, "The lane index and the latch").
// ENGINE_RECORD_LANE writes the number a sweep runs a lane as into a register, and a member of one record is read by
// every lane. One shared record and the lanes enumerate a range, x = base + l, with nothing stored a lane. A hash of
// x against a threshold T, base and T both in the one record, runs over every lane on the host, on the device's
// interpreter and as the compiled program: the three must agree word for word, and each lane's l, x, hash and hit must
// equal the host's own 64-bit arithmetic. The latch is the first lane whose output holds, min{l : cond(l)}, infinity
// where none does. Read on the device by a tree over each warp and one atomic minimum, it must return the lane the
// host's serial scan over the same records returns and the first lane the host's own arithmetic finds, at every
// threshold from every lane hitting to none, and over 2^24 lanes on the device with only the lane brought back. Its
// edges: lane 0, the last lane, the least of many, a field across two limbs, a field of a whole limb, and bits outside
// the field that must not trip it. Under an index the lane register is still the lane instead of the record it reads. A
// member of two records still errors on a sweep of three lanes, and the latch errors on a field past its record. The
// test is one job on the device's tessera daemon, submitted before its first device work.
