// The Gaussian step as record floors. BBP's base is a power of the Gaussian prime 1 + i: (1 + i)^8 = 16. One step,
// z -> z (1 + i) on z = a + b i, is the floor (a, b) -> (a - b, a + b): one DIFFERENCE and one SUM. It turns z by
// pi / 4 and scales it by the square root of 2, and its determinant is 2. Each floor drops one bit: its image is
// the pairs of equal parity. Eight floors close the turn and leave 16 z. Every lane runs on the device and on the
// host, word for word, and every floor is checked against the Gaussian product z (1 + i)^k taken on the CPU from the
// powers' polar form instead of from the floor. keymath carries every register as a linear form over the two fields and
// bounds it by the sum of |coefficient| 2^bits. After k floors the coefficients are the parts of (1 + i)^k, whose
// magnitudes sum to 2^ceil(k/2). The widths are 24 + ceil(k/2): they grow half a bit a floor, as the values do, and
// some lane fills each one.
// The test is one job on the device's tessera daemon, submitted before the program is loaded onto the device.
