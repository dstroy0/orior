//
// The record machine computes coherently with the 2-adic integers. A two's complement register sign-extended without
// end is a 2-adic integer, and ENGINE_RECORD_WRAP to w bits is the projection onto Z / 2^w. Sum, difference, product,
// xor and and commute with every projection: a program of them run exactly and then wrapped to w equals the same
// program run wrapped to w at every step. Random programs are run both ways at several widths in one record program,
// and both must equal a third reckoning in native 64-bit two's complement reduced to w, on every lane; the device must
// equal the host word for word. A quotient and a comparison read the whole integer, not only its low bits, and must
// break the agreement on some lane. An exact quotient by an odd c is the product by c^-1 in Z_2, and must equal that
// product in every projection. The odd crystals Z_3, Z_5 and Z_7 are orthogonal to Z_2: a ring program commutes with
// the remainder by p^v as it does with the wrap, the machine joins the two windows into the exact run modulo 2^w p^v,
// and an xor, the 2-adic crystal's alone, breaks modulo 3. A table step indexes by its source's magnitude and breaks
// under the wrap; indexed by the two's complement residue x mod 2^b, the and with 2^b - 1 before it, it factors
// through the wrap to every w >= b and breaks narrower. The test is one job on the device's tessera daemon, submitted
// before its first device work.
