//
// The two towers as record floors the engine emits (engine_table.md item 8), each floor focused from a ruleset, the
// wave transform's math, and not written out by hand. A lifting step moves one band of a line by a rounded sum
// over the other, target += sign floor((rounding + sum_k weight_k other[a + offset_k]) / 2^shift), and
// tower_record_lift and tower_record_lower pass a ruleset through a block's extent as record steps, one block of the
// lattice to a lane. The kernels' 5/3 is read against tower_lift and tower_lower lane for lane: on blocks of one to
// four axes, odd extents and even, every volume's T equals tower_lift's crystal at every coefficient, and T^-1 run on
// it equals tower_lower's rebuilt samples and the source, with no ruleset named and with the 5/3 named as its two
// steps. Two rulesets the kernels do not run, the S transform and a four-tap predict, are read against a host
// oracle, which itself equals the kernels on the 5/3. For every ruleset, T read through T^-1 as one program returns
// crystals drawn anywhere in the fields' widths. An operation F read through T^-1 (the block's sum, and its energy
// along x, the sum of the squared differences of x neighbors) equals F on tower_lower's samples. Every program runs
// on the device and the host, word for word. The emitter sizes a program before it is held, and it errors on a register
// that is not earlier, a capacity too small, an empty extent and a malformed step, leaving the program as it was.
// Every sweep gives back the stack its frame grew. The limit after the blocks is the limit before them.
// The test is one job on the device's tessera daemon, submitted before its first device work.
