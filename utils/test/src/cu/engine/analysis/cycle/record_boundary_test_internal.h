//
// The crystal as a boundary, measured on itself. A 5/3 lifting tower T of four levels over 64 samples runs as record
// floors. Its crystal (the level-4 lows and every high, in Mallat order) is the boundary between the tower and its
// inverse, and everything here is read there, not from either end.
//
// Written onto the boundary and read back: arbitrary crystals run through T^-1 then T return exactly. The boundary
// is a whole coordinate chart of Z^n. The precision the boundary reads: a flip of input bit b moves a crystal
// coefficient only at bit b - 3L and above, and for b >= 3L the move is exactly 2^b times a column of T's rational
// matrix M, whose 2-adic valuations give the range per band (3l for the lows at level l, 3l - 2 for its highs). T^-1
// is held to the range L + 2 the same way. What passes through T: a constant added to every sample lands on the
// crystal's lows alone, and a vector in 2^(3L) Z^n lands as M times it; negation and doubling do not pass. The
// identity of a lane's structure, taken with T and null permutations of its own samples: every structured lane's
// crystal heap stands below all its shuffles', and noise no more often than 1 / (draws + 1) allows. The heap
// and the ring at every floor of T then T^-1: the heap mirrors exactly, the ring is ring_0 + n + 2(n - n / 2^l) at
// floor l >= 1 (keymath's linear forms give every register at level l, low and high, w + l + 1 bits) and its mirror
// one bit wider per wrapped low, and the heap's pinch at the crystal orders a ramp, a ramp +-8, a
// ramp +-1024 and noise. Last, the top projection x -> x / 2^k toward zero, the other end of the window from the
// 2-adic projection: nested quotients commute with it, it never reverses a comparison (the 8-bit wrap reverses
// many), and a sum through it is off by at most one. The count each crystal keeps: on a 4-sample tower every input
// quantum at level w + 3 is run, and T and T^-1 send exactly as many onto every output quantum at level w (Haar
// measure on Z_2^n); det M and det M^-1 are +-1 exactly, proved modulo primes past Hadamard's bound (volume on R^n).
// T holds no error correction. A redundant residue code carries the crystal: each coefficient modulo four odd
// primes where two cover its range, decoded in the machine, catches two corrupted residues and corrects one, and T^-1
// of the corrected crystal returns the samples. Every program runs on the device and the host, word for word. The test
// is one job on the device's tessera daemon, submitted before its first device work.
