/**
 * @file test_o2_spawn.c
 * @brief The engine turned onto itself: a descent that resumes from another descent's survivors.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 * @date 2026-09-17
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVES. A single descent places at most ANCHOR_STEER_ANCHORS probes and resets its
 * survivor vector to all standing on entry. That caps one descent at four conditions. The resume
 * member of AnchorSteerDescent lifts the cap by composition: run a descent, then run the next over
 * the survivors the last one left. Each level reads only what its parent kept standing and the
 * depth is data-dependent and unbounded. This suite drives that composition and grades it against the
 * controls a recursive search needs.
 *
 *   POSITIVE CONTROL. A field with one planted occurrence over N alignments. A probe asks every
 *   survivor one yes-or-no question, whether its byte at one offset is the needle's, and keeps the
 *   target's side. Sides that halved the survivors would take log2(N) probes, eleven with N past
 *   2000. The descent places the probe that prunes most and a side can be under half: a given
 *   target can take fewer; the run prints how many. Isolating the target composes past one
 *   descent's cap of four, which the case checks. The lone survivor is then verified against the
 *   whole needle with a full compare before it is called found, which is this tree's rule that a
 *   survivor is not a match until the exact compare confirms it, carried into the recursive setting.
 *   The premise that the target is unique is checked instead of assumed: a repeated target would stall the
 *   descent at its true-occurrence count, and that is a different outcome.
 *
 *   NULL. A flat field matches the needle at every alignment. No probe prunes anything and the
 *   destroy rule ends the composition at depth zero with every alignment still standing. A field with
 *   no cheap condition errors, it does not answer.
 *
 *   ANYTIME. Stopped early, before the target is isolated, the survivor set is still a superset that
 *   contains the target. Containment holds at every level because a probe only ever turns an
 *   alignment off, never on.
 *
 *   COST. The read cost of the composition is the sum of the survivor counts down the levels, not the
 *   universe times the depth, because a resumed level reads only its parent's survivors. Reported for
 *   a pruning field and for a field whose conditions barely prune, the honest boundary: where
 *   nothing prunes cheaply the sum approaches the universe times the depth and the recursion saves
 *   nothing.
 *
 * @note No double, no float, nothing outside the C11 standard headers below. The composition is a
 *       plain loop over anchor_steer_spawn_coarms with resume set after the first call.
