/**
 * @file test_adversarial_internal.h
 * @brief Attacks the steering guarantees instead of confirming them, and grades every arm present.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 * @date 2026-09-16
 *
 * WHY THIS SITS IN utils/test/. A driver in `utils/bench/` builds corpora, counts or times, and prints rows.
 * This file asks whether the engine is right, which is a different question. Douglas put the two
 * questions in two directories. Every case below names the guarantee it attacks and the
 * construction that should break it, and a case that cannot fail when its guarantee is false does
 * not belong here.
 *
 * IT HAS BEEN SEEN TO FAIL. Nothing else separates an adversarial suite from an empty
 * loop. Against the engine as written it passes seven of seven at exit 0. Against three deliberately
 * broken engines it rejects every one, and each mutation is caught by a different set of cases:
 * dropping the full compare so survivors are counted as matches trips the differential net and the
 * survivor case; an off by one in the alignment bound trips overlapping occurrences, the boundary
 * case and the survivor case's read count; and a probe comparing against a constant instead of the
 * needle trips six of the seven. `utils/test/engine/mutate.sh` reproduces all three.
 *
 * A CASE THAT CANNOT FAIL IS NOT A CHECK, and this file learned that about itself. The survivor
 * case was written so that every probe agrees and only the full compare refutes, and it never
 * fired. The steering defeats that construction: the odd byte is the rarest symbol the needle
 * carries. The ordering tests it FIRST, every alignment refutes at the first read, and the full
 * compare never runs. The case sat green and reading it would not have shown why. Mutating the
 * engine to drop the full compare, then watching the case stay green, is what exposed it.
 *
 * The repair is worth more than the catch. That case now runs UNSTEERED, places the difference at
 * an offset the spatial anchors never read, and CHECKS THE PREMISE IT DEPENDS ON: four surviving
 * probes is four reads an alignment and no fewer. A lower count means a probe is refuting and
 * the case has stopped testing what it claims. The premise check then caught the alignment off by
 * one on its own, four reads short of 16260, which is one alignment lost. A case asserting its own
 * preconditions is a different kind of object from one asserting only its conclusion, and every
 * case here that can be given a premise check should get one.
 *
 * FOUR OF THESE ARE DIFFERENTIAL. They compare two routes that must agree. No expected number is
 * written down in advance and none can be written down wrongly. Those are the strongest cases here,
 * and they double in value the moment a second implementation exists: a case passing the portable
 * arm and failing a vectorized one has found a vectorization defect, and a case passing both has
 * been checked twice.
 *
 * WHAT IT COVERS, in the order it runs.
 *
 *   1. EVERY ARM AGREES WITH THE REFERENCE, over many fields, skews, needle lengths and origins.
 *      The net that catches what the designed cases miss.
 *   2. OVERLAPPING OCCURRENCES, where counts classically break, and the first casualty of any shift
 *      rule added later.
 *   3. DEGENERATE LENGTHS AND BOTH BOUNDARIES, including a match at the final alignment, which is
 *      where an off-by-one in the alignment bound hides.
 *   4. A SYMBOL THE FIELD NEVER PRODUCES, graded on the count AND on the read count, because the
 *      cheapness is a separate claim from the answer.
 *   5. EVERY SURVIVOR FALSE. The count cannot be read off the survivor set.
 *   6. SHAPES OUTSIDE THE NECESSARY-CONDITION FAMILY, rejected by the guard instead of believed.
 *   7. WHAT SAMPLING COSTS, reported as a ratio instead of stated as a caveat.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT COVER FROM OUTSIDE, and the entry each one needs, named so the gap is visible
 * instead of quietly absent. Probe order as a permutation null, and a census-derived predicate,
 * both need an entry that runs a search with a CALLER-SUPPLIED probe set. The destroy theorem's
 * consequence needs an entry that runs the descent with the stop condition disabled. The
 * monotonicity precondition needs a candidate set that grows with the level. None of those is
 * reachable through the public header, and each is one function away.
 *
 * @note No double, no float, no <math.h>, and nothing outside the C11 standard headers below.
