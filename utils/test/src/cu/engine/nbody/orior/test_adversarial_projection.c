/**
 * @brief Case 13. A corpus and needle projected apart lose true occurrences; projected together
 *        they do not.
 *
 * @return 0 where the joint route never undercounts, is exact at 256 classes or fewer, and every
 *         premise holds, 1 otherwise.
 *
 * @note THE DEFECT. A rank is a symbol's place in the rarity order of the population one call
 *       counted. The class comes from the oracle the caller supplies, and it is the same
 *       function on both sides. The place comes from counting, and two calls count two populations.
 *       Their orders disagree, rank disagreement stops proving symbol disagreement, and a probe
 *       refutes an alignment whose symbols match.
 *
 * @note THREE PARTS, EACH WITH ITS PREMISE CHECKED.
 *       Part one is the counterexample in its original form, built by hand. The separate
 *       route MUST return 0 there. If it does not, the case no longer reaches the defect and a
 *       passing joint route proves nothing.
 *       Part two is a seeded sweep, needles cut from the corpus on even seeds and drawn
 *       independently on odd ones, over alphabets from 2 to 399 symbols. It grades the joint route
 *       against a direct symbol count on every seed, and requires that the sweep reached both the
 *       exact regime and the clamped one and that the separate route lost at least one occurrence.
 *       Part three builds a field past 256 classes where the clamp merges the two classes the
 *       needle uses. The joint rank count must stay at or above the truth and must exceed it, or
 *       the upper bound anchor_field_pair_project documents has not been measured.
 *
 * @note WHY THE SUITE DID NOT CATCH IT. The one projected search in test_steer builds its rank
 *       needle by copying out of the corpus's own projected ranks (`utils/test/engine/nbody/orior/test_steer_*.c`,
 *       the loop filling `rank_needle`). Its needle and corpus come from one population by
 *       construction and the two orders could never disagree.
