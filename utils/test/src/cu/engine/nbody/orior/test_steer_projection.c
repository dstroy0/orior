 * THE CASE THAT WAS SILENTLY WRONG. Classes are the transitive closure of the predicate.
 * Agreement must imply a shared rank even where the predicate chains. The check builds a chain,
 * 0 1 2 3 4, where each value agrees with its neighbors at a tolerance of 2 and the ends do not
 * agree with each other at all. The closure is one component. Every position must carry one rank.
 *
 * A grouping that stopped at the first matching representative would have produced more than one
 * class here, and a rank probe built on it would have refuted an alignment holding a true
 * occurrence. This asserts the closure and not the first match, the difference between

/**
 * @brief Grades the any-type path against the byte path, and the projection against the truth.
 *
 * @return Count of failures.
 *
 * TWO CLAIMS, AND ONLY THE SECOND COULD BE WRONG.
 *
 * First, that reaching a byte field through an equality oracle places the SAME offsets as reading it
 * as bytes. The oracle hides only the representation. A different answer would mean
 * the byte path was using something the proof does not license.
 *
 * Second, that projecting a field of any symbol type onto rarity ranks preserves soundness. Two
 * positions carrying the same symbol necessarily carry the same rank. Rank disagreement proves
 * symbol disagreement and a rank probe is a necessary condition. Rank agreement proves nothing,
 * and survivors therefore still reach an exact compare. The check is therefore NOT that the projected
 * count equals the true count: it is that the projected engine loses no true occurrence, the
 * only claim soundness makes. A projection that lost one would be a broken necessary condition
 * and the whole construction with it.
 *
 * The 32 bit sample field is here because a byte engine cannot read it at all. If the projection
 * works the sample field searches at full speed on the same loop bytes use, the point.
