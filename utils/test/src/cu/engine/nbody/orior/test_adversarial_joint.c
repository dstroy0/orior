/**
 * @brief Case 12. A descent stops, recurses, or errors, and never revisits a state.
 *
 * @return Count of failures.
 *
 * THE TRICHOTOMY IS A CLAIM, AND THIS TEST ATTACKS IT. The guide states that a descent takes
 * one of exactly three branches: it stops when the destroy test fires, it recurses when a level
 * prunes, and it errors, not running at all, when the question is malformed. The fourth branch it denies
 * is cycling, returning to a state already held.
 *
 * Each branch is checked separately and the error is checked hardest, because an error that
 * returns zero while having already written to the caller's buffer is indistinguishable from a
 * error that wrote nothing, unless somebody looks at the buffer. Every malformed call below is
 * made against a buffer filled with a sentinel, and the sentinel has to survive.
 *
 * No-revisiting is checked by requiring the placed offsets to be pairwise distinct. A descent that
 * placed the same offset twice would have returned to a state it already held, since placing a probe
 * that is already placed leaves the survivor set exactly as it was.
