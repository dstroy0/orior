// The device pool (engine/runtime/device_pool): a job's device buffers as slices of one allocation. A plan lays out
// each slice at the running sum rounded up to 256 bytes, and the pool is the sum rounded up to the 2 MiB page once:
// a job knows the bytes it declares before any device work. Eight slices of none to 1,000 bytes are laid out at offsets
// worked by hand; single slices on either side of a page round as worked by hand; a plan that would pass 2^62 bytes
// is spoiled and names no pool, and its hold errors. The pool is held as one allocation: each take in the plan's
// order returns the slice the plan laid out, a kernel writes each slice and another reads it back with nothing landing
// between slices, a take past the pool errors and leaves the pool as it was, and a return gives every slice back.
// The pool's cost is read through the counter tessera's daemon reads, for the tower's four buffers as one pool and as
// four allocations. The test is one job on the device's tessera daemon, submitted before its first device work.
