// tessera end to end: the client against the built daemon on this device. The client starts the daemon when no
// daemon answers. Every job is reserved its declaration over the bytes its process already held as it asked, which
// the daemon measures and tells on admission; the test keeps its first job's memory: every later job's process
// stands on it. A job declaring less than it then holds is admitted on its declaration and told it grew; its peak
// is kept under its signum. The same signum declaring four times that peak is asked, and admitted on the override.
// Declaring within the peak it is admitted at once. Declaring over it again with no answer, it is held past its
// holding time and lost, its ticket naming the lost and found place; the precalc kept there releases it. Its ticket
// is sealed with the precalc note in it. Once the daemon has gone, the history it sealed is damaged by one byte, cut
// short, and stripped of its seal, and each time no daemon will start on it; restored, it starts and the kept peak
// is still there. The damage is done in $TESSERA_STATE, which run.sh points at a scratch directory.
