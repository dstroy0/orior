    "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog while the quiet queen quietly questioned whether "
    "the quality of the quotation was quite equal to the requirements of the inquiry. she thought "
    "about the matter for some time and then decided that the answer was probably yes, although "
    "there were several other considerations that might reasonably be taken into account before "
    "any final judgement could be reached on a question of that particular kind. the morning was "
    "bright and the air was cold, and the road ahead of them ran straight for a long distance "
    "before turning sharply to the left and disappearing behind a low hill covered in heather. "
    "they walked without speaking for perhaps half an hour, each of them thinking about something "
    "different, until the sound of running water reached them from somewhere ahead and below. "
    "the river was wider than either of them had expected and the crossing took longer than it "
    "should have done, partly because the stones were slippery and partly because neither of them "
    "wanted to admit to the other that they were frightened of falling. afterwards they sat on the "
    "far bank and dried their feet in the sun and agreed that it had not been so bad after all. "
    "later that evening the weather turned and a thin rain began to fall, first in single drops "
    "that marked the dust and then steadily. That within a quarter of an hour the whole valley "
    "was gray and the far side of it invisible. they sheltered under an overhanging rock and "
    "watched the water gather in the hollows and run away downhill in a hundred small channels, "
    "each one finding its own way among the stones without any apparent difficulty. it occurred to "
    "him that this was how most problems eventually resolved themselves, given enough time and a "
    "sufficient quantity of water, and he said as much aloud. she laughed and said that was the "
    "sort of remark that sounded wiser than it was, and he had to agree that she was probably "
    "right about that as well. by the time the rain stopped the light was almost gone and they "
    "made camp where they stood. the fire took a long "
    "while to catch because everything was wet, and when it did catch it smoked badly and gave "
    "very little heat, but it was something to sit beside and they were both glad of it. in the "
    "morning the sky had cleared completely and the grass was heavy with water that soaked their "
    "boots within the first few steps. neither of them mentioned the conversation of the previous "
    "evening, though both remembered it, and they walked down toward the village in a silence "
    "that was comfortable. the bakery was already open when they arrived and "
    "the smell of it reached them from a considerable distance up the road, which improved their "
    "mood more than anything either of them could have said. ";
