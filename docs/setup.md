# Setup

**Purpose:** Get the engine building and the examples running, and know what each dependency is actually for.
**Scope:** `src/cu/`, `examples/`, `utils/maint/`.

Nothing here needs a GPU, a service, or a network connection except the fetchers, and those are named below.

## Python

Python 3.9 or newer. Developed on 3.14.

```sh
python -m pip install numpy
```

The measure, the reference and every example that reads a corpus you already have need nothing beyond that. The rest are per-tool and each one says so when it is missing:

| package      | what needs it                                                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `numpy`      | the engine, and 75 call sites across the tree                     |
| `pypdf`      | reading papers, `utils/maint/data/salishan/get_papers.py --convert`     |
| `requests`   | the corpus fetchers under `utils/maint/data/fetch/` and `get_papers.py` |
| `matplotlib` | the corpus derivation figure                                      |
| `soundfile`  | the sound representation, which reads recordings                  |
| `Pillow`     | reading an image as a byte sequence                               |

Install what a tool asks for when it asks. A missing package is reported by name with the install line, and the rest of the tree keeps working.

## The C engine

A C11 compiler and CMake, with Ninja as the generator; a bare `cmake` picks NMake on Windows and fails. One command from a fresh clone configures, builds and runs the graders:

```sh
utils/maint/engine/build_engine.sh               # configure, build, run the graders
utils/maint/engine/build_engine.sh --build-only  # configure and build, run nothing
```

On Windows use `utils/maint/engine/build_engine.ps1`, the same two forms. It imports the MSVC environment and compiles the device rasterizer; the shell script run from Git Bash has no MSVC environment and pins the build to gcc or clang. Output lands in `build/engine_c/`; nothing reads it back and you can delete it freely.

Drive the configure yourself with CMake directly for the lower-level path:

```sh
cmake -S src/cu -B build/engine_c -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build/engine_c
```

That produces the benches and the tests. `bench_lattice` needs C99 `_Complex` and does not build under MSVC, which supplies the types without the operators; build it with GCC or Clang, and every other target builds under all three.

The search kernel builds with no build system at all, if that is all you want. It is four portable sources and two include paths:

```sh
gcc -std=c11 -Isrc/cu/engine/nbody/orior -Isrc/cu/types/integers your_program.c \
    src/cu/engine/nbody/orior/orior_*.c src/cu/engine/nbody/orior/scan.c \
    src/cu/types/integers/exact_integer_*.c src/cu/types/integers/arm.c
```

## The research papers

XeLaTeX, from TeX Live or MiKTeX. The build runs it twice per research paper, because the table of contents is written on the first pass and read on the second. XeLaTeX and not LuaLaTeX because arXiv runs XeLaTeX and does not run LuaLaTeX. The fonts are Charis SIL, DejaVu and TeX Gyre Termes Math, all named by file and all shipped with TeX Live 2025.

To package a research paper for arXiv:

```sh
python utils/maint/texbuild/submission_package.py --arxiv <research_paper>
```

The tarball lands in `build/arxiv/<research_paper>.tar` with a `00README.json` that selects XeLaTeX and TeX Live 2025.

```sh
sh utils/maint/texbuild/build_theory.sh
```

PDFs land in `build/theory/<research_paper>/main.pdf`. One research paper on its own:

```sh
sh utils/maint/texbuild/build_theory.sh workbook
```

The build fails if a research paper drops a glyph. That is deliberate: these research papers set Salishan orthography, and a missing character is a silently wrong page.

## Corpora

None are in git. `examples/` takes a corpus path as an argument. Anything you already have works.

To build the language corpora this work measured, the fetchers under `utils/maint/data/fetch/` pull from public archives:

```sh
python utils/maint/data/fetch/fetch_parallel_corpus.py
python utils/maint/data/fetch/fetch_treebanks.py
```

Each one names its source and writes under `build/corpora/`.

The Salishan papers come from the ICSNL archive:

```sh
python utils/maint/data/salishan/get_papers.py
```

The hand extractions are not fetchable. They are transcribed out of published papers and are not carried here, as [What is not here](research.md#what-is-not-here) says. Everything that does not read a paper or a table runs without them.

## Checks

```sh
python utils/maint/prose/docs_check      the register check over every document and comment
python utils/maint/catalog/catalog.py --check       every example carries its catalog number
python utils/maint/catalog/catalog_verify.py        where an example's description and its code disagree
python utils/maint/tree/write_survey.py          every file write in the tree, and where it lands
```

`.githooks/pre-commit` runs the first of these. Turn it on once per clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
