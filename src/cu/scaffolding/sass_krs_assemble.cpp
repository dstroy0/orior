//
// A parameter's kind is not guessed from its name, because one name is two things in two forms: `left` is a register
// in word_bitand and a predicate in predicate_bitxor, `value` a register in test_word_nonzero and a number in word_set. Each

// the form's parameters are.
//
// The forms and their parameters are read from the ruleset's own lines, since the schema keeps only how many
// parameters a form takes. A form the ruleset leaves empty, and a form whose text is a label or a note and carries
// no instruction, are each counted apart: neither is a failure here.
