// kernel, the forms of ptx.krs, into a cubin, and the frame with no body into another; nvdisasm lists each, and the
// operations a question's listing holds past the frame's are its forms' machine code. Then each operation seen, keyed
// by the low 12 bits of its encoding, is decoded with each of its 128 bits turned over, one nvdisasm --binary for all
// 129 encodings: a bit that changes a register operand is that operand's field, one that changes the operation's name
// is the operation's, one the disassembler refuses is an encoding the part lacks, and one that changes nothing in the

// A form found this way is widened in turn, for SASS_WIDEN_ROUNDS rounds. The reach is what one bit at a time gets

// register in a slot and a number in that slot are two bits apart, through the constant in that slot which lies
