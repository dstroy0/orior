// A cubin is an ELF, and almost all of it says what the kernel takes and not what it does: its parameters, the
// constant bank they lie in, its notes, its symbols and its relocations. The cell's probes found that between two
// cubins of one kernel only its code, the size of the code, the count of registers it holds and the offsets of its
// exits differ (engine_plan.md, the SASS findings). A cubin is therefore written by taking one the toolchain made
// for a kernel that takes the same parameters and putting new code in it, in place of laying an ELF out from
// nothing: everything the writer does not understand is carried over, never invented.
//
// The writer is container_write.h's emitter, given a cubin and the cubin's layout file emit/layouts/elf64_nvidia.tsv.
//
// The template's own kernel decides what fits: the same name, the same parameters, the same constant bank. Give
// the writer code that takes other parameters and the cubin loads and reads the wrong parameters.
