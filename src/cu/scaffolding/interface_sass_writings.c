// interface_sass_writings.c: a writing searched for on the part. Every form of the machine file that writes a register
// from registers, predicates and numbers alone is put in place of the kernel's IADD3 with the case's first two words as
// its sources, run on the part over every case at once, and read back against what each ladder relation and each
// precept gives each case. A form that gives every case a relation's word is a writing of that relation in one
// instruction, found by running it and by nothing else: no name, listing or compiler says which form adds. A number
// whose field is eight bits wide is a truth table of three inputs, and a form holding one is put with each of its 256
// values (precept_value.h).
//
// Nothing is compiled and no disassembler is run. The cubins are written here and run by interface_sass_run, which
// holds each to cubin_safe, loads it through the driver and runs it over the cases file this writes, a thread a case.
