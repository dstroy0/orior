// A probe for the interface's PTX test (engine_table.md item 11(f) 4): questions asked of the device in the ruleset's own
// words. Each question's kernel is written from ptx.krs, one form by its name at a time (target.h), around a kernel of
// this probe's own that loads a case's eight input words and stores four output words, and nvJitLink assembles it as
// the engine's PTX path does. The header is asked of NVRTC. One question a process, named by the first word:
//   membership   every arithmetic, test and conversion form the code generator writes, over 65,536 cases of input
//   words, each
//                answer checked against the host's integers; a form's answer where PTX leaves it undefined (a divisor
//                of 0) is printed and not checked. Exit 0 where every defined answer agrees, 1 where one does not
//   address      a load from address 16, which no allocation holds
//   misaligned   a 32-bit load from an address one byte past an allocation's start
//   trap         PTX's trap instruction
//   lacking      elect.sync, which PTX gives sm_90 and later, in a kernel for this device

// allocation gives, "after <code> <name>", and exits 3. One the toolchain errors prints "errored" and its log, and
