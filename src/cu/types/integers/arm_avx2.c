/**
 * @file arm_avx2.c
 * @brief The AVX2 arm of the exact arithmetic, comparing eight 32 bit limbs per instruction.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * @note ONE FILE FOR EVERY x86 BUILD. The loops are a property of the instruction set and are
 *       shared across every operating system. Both ways of asking the processor about AVX2 live
 *       here together with them, and no second copy that could disagree with this one exists.
 * @note Two detection paths, both arms of the gate defined. MSVC has no __builtin_cpu_supports and
 *       takes __cpuidex directly. GCC and Clang have the builtin and use it on any host. A compiler
 *       carrying neither reports the arm absent instead of guessing.
 * @note Asked at run time deliberately. A binary built where AVX2 was available still runs on
 *       machines that lack it, and calling in there raises an illegal instruction.
 * @note THE NAME STILL NAMES THE OPERATING SYSTEM. Two builds running the same instructions have
 *       to be told apart in a row of results, because what a row compares includes the compiler and
 *       the operating system that built it. Folding the files did not change what a row prints.
 * @note Both comparisons walk from the top limb down. At a scale of 1024 decimal digits a deposited
 *       value has hundreds of trailing zero digits. The low limbs are zero on both sides and carry
 *       no information. The first difference is near the top and the scan finds it at once.
