/**
 * @file arm_cuda.h
 * @brief The exact measure on a CUDA device, parallel over positions instead of over limbs.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * @note The vectorized arms widen one comparison. This one does not widen a comparison at all: it
 *       gives one position to each thread and runs the whole search for that position there. The
 *       limb arithmetic on the device is the portable arithmetic, transcribed for the device and
 *       checked against the host the same way every other arm is.
 * @note A big integer is a fixed width limb array here exactly as it is on the host. A device can
 *       hold one for that reason alone. The representation is a transform of the value, and the
 *       device carries the same transform, one warp's worth of limbs at a time.
 * @note Only `agreement` is handed over. A single comparison is far too small to be worth a bus
 *       crossing. The arm's `equal` and `compare` stay on the host and are the portable ones.
