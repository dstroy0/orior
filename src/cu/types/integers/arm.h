 * @file arm.h
 * @brief One interface every implementation of the exact measure presents, letting a driver call any.

 *
 * @note Every engine returns the same counts. Where two disagree one of them has a defect, and
 *       nothing about the difference is a tradeoff. This is the same contract OriorEngine
 *       carries for the search kernel and it is kept for the same reason.
 * @note The portable arm is the reference. It is always present, uses no intrinsic and no compiler
 *       extension, and every other arm is graded against it on the same data.
 * @note An arm reports itself absent at run time where the machine cannot run it. A build that
 *       compiled an AVX2 arm still has to ask the processor before calling it, since the build
 *       machine and the running machine are not the same machine.
