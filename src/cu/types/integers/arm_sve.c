/**
 * @file arm_sve.c
 * @brief The SVE arm of the exact arithmetic, at whatever vector length the part turns out to have.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * @note Written for server class ARM: Graviton, Ampere Altra, Grace, the Neoverse cores. No part in
 *       this project has SVE. The Raspberry Pi 5 is a Cortex-A76, which is NEON only. This arm has
 *       never been run. It is compiled for armv8.2-a+sve and its emitted instructions are read by
 *       utils/maint/engine/verify_arm_asm.sh, which confirms the predicated forms. That says the intrinsics
 *       became SVE instructions and not a scalar fallback. It says nothing about behavior, and the
 *       arm's name carries that.
 * @note SVE has no fixed vector length. A part may be 128, 256, 512 bits or more, and the same
 *       binary runs on all of them: svcntw() answers how many 32 bit lanes this part carries and the
 *       loop is written around a predicate instead of around a constant. No lane count appears in
 *       this file for that reason, and the tail needs no separate scalar loop.
 * @note Detection reads the hardware capability word Linux exposes, never executing an SVE
 *       instruction to see whether it faults. There is no cpuid on ARM: a part's features come from
 *       the kernel, and on anything other than Linux this arm reports itself absent instead of
 *       guessing.
