/**
 * @file arm_neon.c
 * @brief The NEON arm: the same limb comparison, four limbs to an instruction instead of eight.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * @note Written for the Raspberry Pi 5, which is a Cortex-A76 at aarch64. NEON is mandatory in the
 *       base aarch64 architecture. On a 64 bit ARM build there is nothing to detect and the arm
 *       is always available. A 32 bit ARM build is a different matter and is gated below.
 * @note A NEON register is 128 bits and holds four 32 bit limbs against AVX2's eight. The loop is
 *       otherwise identical. The arithmetic belongs to the representation and not to the
 *       instruction set, and every arm has to return what the portable one returns.
 * @note vceqq_u32 sets a lane to all ones where the two limbs match. There is no movemask on NEON.
 *       The four lanes are folded to one 64 bit pair with vminvq_u32, which returns the smallest
 *       lane: that is zero exactly when some lane failed to match.
