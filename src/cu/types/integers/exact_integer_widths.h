 * @brief Limbs per exact integer, at 32 bits each, a power of two for a power-of-two width.
 *
 * @note Given as limbs here or as bits in ANCHOR_EXACT_BITS. The one not given follows from the
 *       other, and both given must agree. The widths are written without casts so #if can weigh
 *       them.
 * @note 128 limbs is 4096 bits, which holds 1024 decimal digits with room over. That is the scale
 *       representation/exact.py ingests at, and the two forms have to agree on the same values or
 *       a cross check between them means nothing.
 * @note The value a limb array carries is the expansion sum(limb[i] * (2^32)^i), whose top
 *       coefficient is the width 2^ANCHOR_EXACT_BITS. A power of two limb count makes that width a
 *       power of two. The top magnitude bit then lands at a fixed position, and the width scales by
 *       doubling, 4096 to 8192 to 16384 bits, with the position fixed at each. The guard below
 *       errors on a width that is not a power of two.
 * @note A build selects any power of two from 1 limb up, 32 bits up, with no ceiling. Every arm is
 *       graded from 1 limb to 32768 by utils/maint/engine/check_exact_widths.sh, and the portable
 *       reference to 4194304 bits by utils/test/src/cu/types/integers/exact_transform_test.sh.
 * @note A width below 4096 bits cannot hold the 1024 digit floor. A build selecting one declares
 *       its own ANCHOR_EXACT_DIGITS, and the floor assert below errors on it by name where it does not.
 * @note Defined on both arms so #if always has a value and an unset build is never a silent false.

 * @note The floor counts every digit of the stored integer, the integer part of the value included.
 *       A value carried at d decimal places is stored as value times 10^d. At d = 1024 the width
 *       holds a magnitude below 2^4096 / 10^1024, about 1e209, and errors on anything larger. The

 *       which this width holds and the earlier 3456-bit width errored.
 * @warning Never size a buffer from this. A width computed from digits is short the moment anybody
 *          raises the floor toward the real capacity, and a device allocation sized that way would
 *          be short by exactly the amount nobody was watching. Size from ANCHOR_EXACT_LIMBS or from
 *          sizeof(AnchorExactInteger), which cannot drift apart from the array they describe.
 * @note Defined on both arms, like the limb count. A build can then raise the floor and the assert
