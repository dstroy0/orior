     * @brief Answers whether two positions carry the same symbol.
     *
     * @param[in] field     Whatever the caller is searching, opaque to the engine [BORROWS].
     * @param[in] corpus_at Position in the field.
     * @param[in] needle_at Position in the pattern.
     * @return              Non-zero where the two positions carry the same symbol, zero otherwise.
     *
     * @note THIS IS THE WHOLE INTERFACE THE ENGINE NEEDS TO A SYMBOL. Not an order, not a hash, not a
     *       size, not an enumeration of the alphabet. Equality at two positions only, the
     *       one relation the soundness proof uses: a subset of a pattern's points is a necessary
     *       condition, and the proof reads neither order, dimension nor alphabet.
     * @note A symbol may therefore be a byte, a 32 bit sample, an exact rational, a point in eight
     *       dimensions, a pointer compared by identity, or a value only its owner can compare. The
     *       engine never learns which. An alphabet that cannot be enumerated or hashed costs it
     *       nothing.
     * @note NO ENGINE HERE IS NARROWER THAN THE PROOF. bench_lattice takes a callback, and the python
     *       cascade needs no bytes: its `survivors` indexes a dict by symbol and `positions_by_symbol`
     *       builds that dict from any iterable of values. It requires equality and hashability only,
     *       and a crystallography example feeds it element strings. A C entry that took only a
     *       `uint8_t *` would be narrower than the proof it implements and than the python engine it is
     *       checked against.
     * @note The two are not equivalent, and the difference runs this way. A dict key must be hashable;
     *       this oracle asks only whether two positions are equal. A value that cannot be hashed, or
     *       whose equality is expensive and whose hash would be a lie, can be searched here and cannot
     *       be searched there. Anyone grading the two engines against each other should know
     *       which fields only one of them can accept.
     * @warning Must be a pure function of the two positions for the duration of a call. The engine
     *          reads the same position more than once and assumes the answer does not move under it.

     * @return         1 where the projection was written, 0 where it errored.
     *
     * @warning RANKS FROM TWO CALLS ARE NOT COMPARABLE, AND COMPARING THEM LOSES TRUE OCCURRENCES.
     *          A rank is not a property of a symbol. It is a property of a symbol WITHIN THE POPULATION
     *          THIS CALL SAW, and the population is part of the answer. The class a position falls in
     *          comes from the oracle, which the CALLER supplies. It is the same relation whatever
     *          field it is applied to. The rarity place comes from counting THIS field. It is not.
     *          The rank fuses the two and only the first half survives the trip to another field.
     *
     *          It is a hash and a nonce. The class is the digest and the population is the nonce, and a
     *          digest computed under one nonce cannot be checked against a digest computed under
     *          another however identical the input was.
     *
     *          THE FAILURE IS SILENT AND IT IS IN THE UNSAFE DIRECTION. Take symbols where A occurs
     *          once, B ten times and C a hundred times, and search for the needle C C B A. Projected
     *          alone, the corpus ranks A below B because one is rarer than ten. Projected alone, the
     *          needle holds one A and one B, they TIE, and the tie breaks on class index the other way
     *          round. Rank disagreement then reports symbol disagreement where the symbols agree, a
     *          probe refutes an alignment that truly matches, and the count comes back one short with
     *          nothing in the return value to say so.
     *
     *          That inverts the necessary condition this construction rests on. Everywhere else in this
     *          file an ordering decision is a null: a wrong order costs reads and leaves the count
     *          unchanged. Here a wrong order loses a true occurrence.
     *
     *          Use anchor_field_pair_project to search one field for another. It numbers both in one
     *          call, which gives one population and one rarity order, and the ranks it writes are
     *          comparable by construction. This entry remains the one to call for describing a single
     *          field.
     *
     * @note THE COMPONENT COUNT IS UNBOUNDED AND ONLY THE OUTPUT IS CLAMPED. Classes are discovered
     *       with no ceiling, ordered by rarity across every one of them, and the byte rank is clamped
     *       at relabel time. A field with a thousand classes keeps its 255 rarest apart and merges
     *       the commonest into rank 255. That is the direction the steering needs, because a probe's
     *       survivor count is its class frequency and the rarest class is the best probe available.
     *       The class buffers exist to carry those components; the kernel allocates nothing.
     *
     * @note `same_in_field` NEED NOT BE TRANSITIVE, AND THE CLASSES ARE ITS TRANSITIVE CLOSURE. This
     *       matters because the predicate that motivates having an oracle at all is not transitive: a
     *       tolerance match over real valued coordinates is meaningful, and `a` within tolerance of `b`
     *       and `b` of `c` does not put `a` within tolerance of `c`.
     *       `examples/proteins/5_sift/protein_domain.py:66-74` is exactly that, and states why exact
     *       equality is the wrong test on a continuous domain.
     *
     *       Soundness needs agreement to imply a shared rank. It does NOT need a shared rank to imply
     *       agreement. The labeling has to be a superset of the relation, and the smallest superset
     *       that is an equivalence is the transitive closure. Classes are therefore connected
     *       components: a position joins every class it matches and merges them.
     *
     * @warning THE COST OF TAKING THE CLOSURE IS CHAINING. A loose tolerance can walk the whole field
     *          into one component through a path of near neighbors, none of which agree with the ends.
     *          One class ranks everything alike, every rank probe then refutes nothing, and the search
     *          falls back to the exact compare at every alignment. That is useless and it is exactly
     *          sound, since a probe that rejects nothing is still a necessary condition. Tighten the
     *          predicate where it happens; the symptom is `distinct` coming back as one on a field the
     *          caller expects to be varied.
     * @warning TAKES A DIFFERENT ORACLE FROM AnchorField's, AND THE DISTINCTION IS NOT COSMETIC.
     *          AnchorSameAt as used by a descent answers about a CORPUS position against a NEEDLE
     *          position, which are two index spaces. Grouping a field into classes compares two
     *          positions of the FIELD. Passing a descent's oracle here indexes the needle with a field
     *          position and reads off the end of it. This signature keeps the two apart.
     *
     * WHY PROJECT AT ALL. A probe only has to be a necessary condition of an occurrence. Within one
     * projection, two positions in one class carry one rank. Rank disagreement proves symbol
     * disagreement and a rank probe refutes a subset of what a symbol probe refutes. Rank agreement does
     * not prove symbol agreement, and a filter does not need it to. The engine's construction is that a
     * necessary condition may be weaker than the thing it screens for.
     *
     * That buys the wide path. An equality oracle cannot be vectorized, because a wide compare
     * is a statement about a representation and the oracle deliberately hides one. Ranks are bytes.
     * A field of any symbol type therefore becomes a field the existing byte engine reads at full speed, AVX2
     * scan included. A real valued alphabet, a point in eight dimensions and an opaque handle all
     * project to the same shape and all run on the same loop.
     *
     * @note Ranks are ORDERED BY RARITY, rarest first, the order the steering already wants.
     *       The rank is therefore not an arbitrary label: rank zero is the class that refutes most
     *       alignments, and a planner reading the projected field gets the entropy ordering for free.
     * @note A SEARCH OVER RANK FIELDS COUNTS RANK MATCHES, AND THAT EQUALS THE SYMBOL COUNT ONLY AT 256
     *       CLASSES OR FEWER. Places then run from 0 to 255 and none is clamped. One rank names one
     *       class and the two counts are the same integer. Past 256 classes every class at place 255 or
     *       later takes rank 255, alignments whose symbols differ can agree on every rank, and the byte
     *       engine's full compare cannot remove them, because on rank fields it compares ranks. The
     *       count is then an upper bound. It never falls below the symbol count, and case 13 in
     *       utils/test/src/cu/engine/nbody/orior/test_adversarial_*.c measures it above: 44 against 1 on a
     *       300-class field.
     * For an exact count past 256 classes, check the rank survivors against the symbols through the oracle, or give the
     * oracle to a descent directly.
     * @warning COSTS UP TO `length` SQUARED ORACLE CALLS AND THAT IS NOT A LOOSE BOUND. Computing the
     *          transitive closure of a graph reachable only through a pairwise probe needs the pairs,
     *          and the predicate may be one the caller chose for being approximate. There is no
     *          correct shortcut. The only saving taken is skipping a pair already in one component,
     *          which is real on a chained field and nothing on a field of singletons.
     *
     *          Comparing each position against one representative per class is `length` times
     *          `distinct` and is correct ONLY for a transitive predicate. It is not offered as a fast
     *          path, because selecting it would be asserting transitivity and the cost of being wrong
     *          is a silently wrong answer.
     *
     *          A field of a few thousand positions projects in a moment; one of a hundred thousand does
     *          not. Project a representative slice, or do not project at all and pass the oracle
     *          straight to a descent, which needs no closure and no projection and costs nothing extra.
