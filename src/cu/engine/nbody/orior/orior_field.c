 * @param[in]  field                 Passed to the oracle untouched [BORROWS].
 * @param[in]  length                Positions in the population.
 * @param[out] class_of_position     Which class each position fell in [BORROWS].
 * @param[out] members_in_class      How many positions each class holds [BORROWS].
 * @param[out] rarity_place_of_class Where each class sits in the rarity order [BORROWS].
 * @return                           Classes surviving the merges.
 *
 * @note Static and positional, which is where a long parameter list is allowed to live, and the
 *       same shape steer_descend uses for the same reason. The public entries take one const
 *       argument pointer each and both call this.
 * @note THE POPULATION IS THE ARGUMENT. One call numbers one
 *       population. Every rank it produces is comparable with every other rank it produced and
 *       with none produced elsewhere. anchor_field_pair_project hands it a corpus and a needle
 *       together for exactly that reason.
