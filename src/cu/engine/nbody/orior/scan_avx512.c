/**
 * @file scan_avx512.c
 * @brief The steering scan under AVX-512, sixty-four alignments per compare.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * THE SAME QUESTION AVX2 ANSWERS, TWICE THE WIDTH. Held at one needle offset, does
 * `corpus[at + offset]` equal `needle[offset]` for consecutive `at`. The needle byte broadcasts
 * once, the corpus side is a sliding window at unit stride, and the survivor mask enters as the
 * alignments still standing. AVX-512 answers sixty-four of those in one compare.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARM IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO. It returns the portable arm's count or it has a defect. The
 * value is an integer count of alignments and the two arms agree exactly or one is wrong. That is
 * the contract AnchorSteerEngine carries, the same one the exact arms carry in src/cu/types/integers/arm.h.
 *
 * @note No machine in this project has AVX-512. This arm has never been run. It is compiled for
 *       the target and its emitted instructions are read by utils/maint/engine/verify_arm_asm.sh, which
 *       confirms zmm registers and vpcmpeqb against a mask. That rules out a silent fallback to
 *       scalar code. It says nothing about behavior, and the name reads avx512-unrun for that reason.
 * @note AVX-512 comparison writes a mask register, one bit per lane. The count is a population
 *       count over the AND of two masks: where the corpus agrees, and where the alignment stands.
 *       That is a different instruction shape from the AVX2 movemask and not a widening of it.
 * @note Detection asks for AVX-512F and AVX-512BW together. The byte compare and the byte test are
 *       BW instructions, and a part with F alone would fault on them.
 * @note The tail below sixty-four is finished scalar, the same code the portable arm runs. A masked
 *       tail is cheap on this instruction set, and the scalar one is chosen to keep every scan arm
 *       the same shape, since an unrun arm is for correctness and not for the tail's cost.
