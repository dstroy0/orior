/**
 * @file scan_avx2.c
 * @brief The steering scan under AVX2, thirty-two alignments per compare.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * WHY THIS SHAPE VECTORIZES AT ALL. Every hot loop in the steering engine asks the same question:
 * held at one needle offset, does `corpus[at + offset]` equal `needle[offset]`, for consecutive
 * `at`. The needle byte is fixed across the whole sweep. It broadcasts once. The corpus side is a
 * sliding window read at unit stride. That is one wide load against one broadcast register, and it
 * answers thirty-two alignments in the instruction where the portable arm answers one.
 *
 * The survivor mask enters the same way. An alignment already refuted contributes nothing. The
 * count is a population count over the AND of two masks: where the corpus agrees, and where the
 * alignment was still standing.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARM IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO. It returns the portable arm's count or it has a defect. There
 * is no tolerance, no reordering that changes an answer, and no fast path that is right most of the
 * time: the value is an integer count of alignments and the two arms agree exactly or one is wrong.
 * That is the contract src/cu/types/integers/arm.h states for the exact arms and it is kept here for the same
 * reason.
 *
 * @note Asks the processor at run time and not the build. A binary compiled with AVX2 available
 *       still runs on machines without it, and calling in would raise an illegal instruction.
 * @note Two detection paths, both arms of the gate defined. MSVC has no __builtin_cpu_supports and
 *       takes __cpuidex; GCC and Clang have the builtin.
 * @note The tail below thirty-two is finished scalar and not masked. A masked tail costs more to
 *       get right than it saves at this width, and the scalar remainder is the same code the
 *       portable arm runs.
