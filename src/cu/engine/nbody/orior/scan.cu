/**
 * @file scan.cu
 * @brief The steering scan on a CUDA device, one alignment per thread over the whole object.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * THE SAME QUESTION EVERY SCAN ARM ANSWERS, MAPPED OVER THE DEVICE. Held at one needle offset, count
 * the alignments still standing whose corpus byte equals the needle byte. The vector arms widen one
 * compare; this one gives one alignment to each thread and adds a one where that alignment agrees and
 * stands. The reduction is a single atomic increment per agreeing thread, what the exact
 * device arm does and needs no tuning at this size.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARM IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO. It returns the portable arm's count or it has a defect. The
 * value is an integer count of alignments and the two arms agree exactly or one is wrong. That is
 * the contract AnchorSteerEngine carries, the same one the exact arms carry in no_rounding.
 *
 * @note NOT SHARED SOURCE WITH THE HOST ARMS. A device function carries __global__ or __device__ on
 *       every declaration. The kernel cannot be the portable loop compiled twice, and the two can
 *       drift. The GPU build grades every count this arm returns against the portable host arm on
 *       the same data, what catches a drift.
 * @note THE WHOLE OBJECT CROSSES THE BUS PER CALL. The corpus and the survivor vector are copied to
 *       the device. This arm pays a transfer a host arm does not. It wins only where the object is
 *       large enough to amortize that. It is graded and timed and not placed in
 *       anchor_steer_best_engine.
 * @note A device error falls back to a host count instead of returning a sentinel into a table of
 *       counts, matching arm.cu. A driver comparing arms would otherwise read the sentinel as a
 *       disagreement and blame the scan for what was an allocation failure.
