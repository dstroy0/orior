    /**
     * @brief Everything a descent reads, as one argument.
     *
     * ONE STRUCT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. The reordering descent and the spawning descent ask the same
     * question of the same field and differ only in where their candidates come from. Nine or ten
     * positional parameters, four of them `size_t` in a row, would be a call a reader cannot check and
     * a caller can transpose silently.
     *
     * @note AN OMITTED MEMBER IS ZERO AND THAT IS PART OF THE CONTRACT. `sample_stride` of zero is read
     *       as one, `force_full_depth` of zero honors the destroy rule, `any` of zero takes the byte
     *       path, and `resume` of zero resets the survivors to all standing. A caller that omits all four
     *       gets the full sweep, the destroy rule, bytes, and a fresh survivor set, as almost every
     *       caller wants.
     *
     * ANY SYMBOL TYPE, THROUGH `any`. Set it and the engine reads the field only through an equality
     * oracle, never touching `corpus` or `needle`. That is not a convenience wrapper over the byte path;
     * it is the path the theory describes, and the byte members are the specialization. Soundness uses
     * equality alone and reads no order, no dimension and no alphabet. An engine that demands a
     * `uint8_t *` is narrower than its own proof. The byte path stays because it is faster and because
     * every existing caller passes bytes.
     *
     * WHAT `force_full_depth` EXISTS TO MAKE TESTABLE. The descent normally stops at a level whose best
     * candidate leaves the truthy population unchanged, and destroys every level below it. Stopping and
     * continuing are therefore claimed to be equivalent, and this member lets a caller check the claim
     * instead of believing it. Set it, and THE COUNT PRODUCED BY THE RESULTING PROBE SET MUST BE
     * IDENTICAL while the placed probe count MAY be larger. A test comparing the two runs gets two
     * separable failures: if the counts ever differ the necessary-condition guarantee broke, and if the
     * probes placed before the stop point ever differ the induction broke. One member, two meanings a
     * reader can tell apart.
     *
     * @note A member an omitted initializer leaves zero does this work, and a second entry sharing one
     *       descent would be the drift this structure exists to remove.
     * @warning Every pointer here is BORROWED for the duration of the call. `survivors` is written and
     *          `corpus` and `needle` are only read.

     *                              depth reached, and see the note below on `force_full_depth`.
     *
     * WHY RECURSION BUYS ANYTHING OVER ONE PASS. anchor_steer_probe_order ranks the anchors once, by
     * the MARGINAL rarity of each symbol in the whole field. That is the right first question and the
     * wrong second one: once the first probe has rejected almost everything, the alignments still
     * standing are no longer a sample of the field. They are the subset that agreed with one specific
     * symbol, and within that subset the remaining anchors have different pruning power than they had
     * over the field. Ranking the second anchor by its marginal rarity ignores what the first one just
     * told you.
     *
     * This ranks each level against the alignments that actually survived the levels above it: the
     * CONDITIONAL distribution and not the marginal one. It also measures survivors directly
     * instead of inferring them from symbol frequency. Correlation between positions is accounted
     * for and not assumed away.
     *
     * IT CANNOT FAIL TO TERMINATE, AND NOT BECAUSE ANYBODY CHECKED. The halting problem is about
     * deciding termination for an ARBITRARY program. This recursion is not arbitrary:
     *
     *   - exactly one anchor is placed per level, and a placed anchor is never reconsidered
     *   - the unplaced set therefore shrinks by exactly one each level and never grows
     *   - the depth is AT MOST `count`, which is bounded by ANCHOR_STEER_ANCHORS, a compile-time
     *     constant, and the loop cannot run past it whatever the corpus holds
     *
     * So the depth is bounded from ABOVE before the program runs, and that bound is what terminates it:
     * a strictly shrinking unplaced set under a constant ceiling, the way a `for` loop over a fixed
     * array does. There is no runtime guard, no iteration cap and no watchdog, because a bound enforced
     * at compile time does not need one.
     *
     * THE DEPTH IS NOT FIXED, THOUGH. Corpus content decides the descent's depth as well as its choice
     * at a level, unless `force_full_depth` is set. The destroy test reads a survivor count off the
     * corpus and breaks. The field routinely ends the descent early, and an omitted member is zero so
     * that is the default path. Depth is a truthy and falsy steer bounded above by a constant, and the
     * return value exists for a caller to read the depth actually reached instead of assuming `count`.
     *
     * @note THE PLANNER IS ALLOWED TO BE WRONG. Ordering cannot change which alignments survive, since
     *       an alignment survives only when every anchor agrees and a conjunction is order independent.
     *       A planner that samples, guesses badly, or is outright defective therefore costs speed and
     *       cannot cost correctness, and `sample_stride` is safe for the same reason: planning on a subset risks a
     *       worse order and never a wrong count.
     * @note Does nothing and returns 0 where any pointer is null, where `count` is zero, or where
     *       `needle_len` is zero. A zero length needle has no symbol to rank.

     *
     * SPAWNING. anchor_steer_plan_recursive takes anchors somebody else placed
     * and decides the order to test them in. This decides WHERE THEY GO. At each level it asks every
     * position in the needle how many of the currently surviving alignments would still stand if a
     * coarm were placed there, and puts one at the position that leaves fewest. The arm is spawned at
     * the place the field says is worth reading, and not at a place a spread rule chose before the
     * field was looked at.
     *
     * That is the same steering the rest of this file applies, moved from the order to the placement.
     * The spread rule above answers "where, knowing nothing" and this answers "where, given the corpus
     * and given what the coarms already placed have ruled out".
     *
     * THIS DESCENT IS GREEDY COVERAGE MAXIMIZATION AND CARRIES ITS GUARANTEE. Each probe rejects a
     * definite set of alignments, and the alignments a probe SET rejects is the union of those sets.
     * A union of sets is monotone and submodular, because an alignment already rejected contributes
     * nothing when rejected again. Choosing the candidate that leaves fewest survivors is choosing the
     * largest marginal gain on that union. By Nemhauser, Wolsey and Fisher 1978, greedy maximization of
     * a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint reaches at least 1 - 1/e of the best
     * set of the same size. The probes placed here reject at least about 63 percent of what the
     * optimal `wanted` probes would reject.
     *
     * @warning THE GUARANTEE IS ON ALIGNMENTS REJECTED AND NOT ON READS. Rejecting an alignment early
     *          saves the reads a later probe would spend on it. Two probe sets covering the same
     *          alignments can cost different numbers of reads. It assumes marginal gains are
     *          scored exactly, which holds only at `sample_stride` of one. Above one the scoring is
     *          taken on a sample, the oracle is approximate, and the ratio no longer holds as stated.
     *
     * TERMINATION IS A BOUND FROM ABOVE AND NOT A FIXED DEPTH. One coarm per level, a placed position
     * never reconsidered, and depth AT MOST `wanted`, which the guard holds at or under
     * ANCHOR_STEER_ANCHORS. The loop cannot run longer than that whatever the corpus holds, and
     * it therefore terminates.
     *
     * IT CAN RUN SHORTER, AND CORPUS CONTENT DECIDES WHEN. The destroy test compares the best
     * candidate's surviving population against the current one, and that count is read off the corpus.
     * Where nothing prunes, the descent breaks early. `force_full_depth` exists precisely to override
     * that, and an omitted member is zero. On the DEFAULT path the field ends the
     * descent. bench_sigma measures it: with `wanted` fixed at 4 on every row, `placed` comes back 2 at
     * an alphabet of 2^8 and 1 from 2^16 up, because a larger alphabet lets the first probe cut far
     * enough that a second buys nothing.
     *
     * Depth is a truthy and falsy steer like everything else here, bounded above by a constant and
     * free to come in under it.
     *
     * The return value is there for a caller to read the depth actually reached instead of assuming
     * `wanted`, which matters where the two can differ.

     * @param[in] corpus     Bytes to search [BORROWS].

     * @param[in] needle     Bytes to find [BORROWS].
     * @param[in] needle_len How many.

     * @param[in] count      How many probes. Zero sends every alignment to the full compare.
     * @return               How many alignments match exactly.
     *
     * @note THE ENTRY A TEST NEEDS AND A CALLER RARELY DOES. Everything else here chooses its own
     *       probes, the point of a steering engine and is also what makes the guarantee hard
     *       to attack from outside. This takes the probe set as an argument. A caller can hand over
     *       a permutation of one set and check the count is unchanged, hand over a probe built from the
     *       census instead of the needle and watch the count break, or hand over none at all.
     * @note The empty probe set is the identity. Every alignment reaches the full compare, the answer
     *       is exactly right, and the cost is maximal. That is the cheapest total check of the whole
     *       guarantee and it is why `count` of zero is accepted and not errored.
     * @note `anchor_steer_probes` counts the corpus bytes the probes read, as it does for
     *       anchor_steer_count. Reset it before a run and read it after.
