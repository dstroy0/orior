// The code generator's text as a record program, the code generator's work where the programs run (engine_table.md item
// 11(a), the code generator on the device). The core decides the forms of the language's ruleset a lane is written
// in (codegen_core.h, MachineInstr); the assembly printer writes their text from the ruleset's own written forms laid
// out as tables, a lane a byte. Each lane reads one form, by the index, finds which of the form's pieces holds its
// byte, and writes that byte: a letter of a piece of the form's text, of a bank's written form around a register's
// number, of a word the ruleset holds whole, or a decimal digit of a number. A lane past its form's end writes 0, which
// no text holds: the text is the lanes' bytes in lane order with the zeros left out. The host lays out once what is the
// ruleset's, the target's and the header's alone (asm_printer_ruleset_build); the forms' records are laid out from the
// items by the functions below, which the device runs (codegen_device.h) and the host oracle runs (asm_printer_host):
