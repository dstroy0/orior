#include "precepts.h"

// A tree over the alphabet is a number, and needs no table. Most of the code is unfurling and binary
// trees in the compiler, and that is easily represented with math.
//
// The alphabet gives every symbol a fixed arity, and a tree written in prefix order with fixed arities needs no
// parentheses and no child pointers: reading the symbols left to right, each one takes exactly as many subtrees as
// its arity, and where the next subtree ends is never in doubt. A tree is then a string over the alphabet, and a
// string over an alphabet of TREE_SYMBOLS symbols is a number in base TREE_SYMBOLS.
//
// The alphabet is the PRECEPT_COUNT precepts and the leaves a word can name: its operands, and the word of zeroes
// and the word of ones that a rewrite needs and no operand carries. 24 symbols and 13 places is 24^13, or 8.76e17,
// which sits inside an unsigned long long. Every tree in either web is one 8-byte number.
//
// This buys no bytes. web_check measures both and the node lists win at this size - 21 trees hold 32 nodes
// between them, three bytes each, against eight bytes a tree for the numbers - because most words are a single node
// and a tree has to reach five before a number pays for itself. It buys one form per tree. A node list
// carries an ordering the tree does not have: the same tree written by two hands numbers its nodes differently, and
// the two lists differ where the trees do not. As a number, one tree is one value. Two subtrees are the same
// subtree where their numbers are equal, a compare in place of a walk, and a .kdm keyed on subtrees rests on that,
// as does the compiler reading its own trees.
// Past 13 places the number outgrows an unsigned long long, and the container changes where the encoding does not.
// The engine already holds an exact integer of any width - AnchorExactInteger in
// src/cu/types/integers/exact_integer_api.h, limbs least significant first with the sign held apart -
// and a tree's number in base TREE_SYMBOLS is written into one the same way it is written into a word here.
//
// Nothing reaches for it yet, and this is the size where that stops being true: a fixed-arity tree never passes 5
// nodes, and an unfurled one passes 13 at once. A ripple adder is a rank of gates per bit, putting a 32-bit add
// over a hundred nodes and a 64-bit multiply in the thousands. The width-counted node is not designed, and the
// exact integer is where its numbers go when it is.
