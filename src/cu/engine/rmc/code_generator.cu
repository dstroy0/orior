// The record program as a register lane, in any language whose ruleset writes the lane's forms: each step
// unrolled at its widths into straight-line text over registers the lane holds itself. The
// file is a bank by place and its signs another, as key_schedule laid them out; the record's words are a bank, laid out
// by each put and each stored once the last put that lays it out has run; the atoms' words are a bank, each loaded
// at its first reader. What a compiler would loop over a register's limbs is written out here limb by limb from
// the program's own widths. The code generator writes no text of its own: every line is a form of the language's
// ruleset, and every register a written form of its banks and fixed registers. The code generator decides what a step
// does and the ruleset how the language writes it. What each step does, and the lane's opening, close and split into
// states, is decided in codegen_core.h, which the device compiles as well; here the forms it decides are written in the
// ruleset and laid out into the text in its order. The steps that loop on their values are loops of the same forms,
// each body over registers of fixed widths so no limb is named by a value the lane computes: the gcd, the golden
// ladder, a division by more than one limb, and a product too wide to unroll. A loop is a label and a branch back to it
// on a predicate, which a language that clocks the lane splits into states that go back. The lane calls nothing and
// takes no shared memory. Every step is the interpreter's arithmetic limb for limb, branch-free where the interpreter
// branches on a sign or a borrow, and CYCLE_RECORD_CHECK=1 holds the two to each other. After the lane comes the
// program resident that runs its launch's lanes (program_unit), the kernel the record machine launches or a circuit's
// top. The text is the whole program, and nothing hand-written is linked with it.

// Where each bank begins in the register file, and how many registers one of its own takes. A language whose
// registers are virtual gives every bank a namespace of its own and leaves this zero; a language with one register
// file has every bank in that file, and a bank numbered from 0 like every other collides with them. The banks are
// laid end to end from the counts the lane declares, and a bank whose registers are 64 bits takes two of the file's for
// each of its own.
