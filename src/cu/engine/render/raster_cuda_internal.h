/**
 * @file raster_cuda_internal.h
 * @brief The device arm of the direct renderer. Same configuration, same bytes as the host arm.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * ONE THREAD PER ALIGNMENT. Rendering is the search. The parallel decomposition is the search's:
 * every alignment is independent until it reduces into a pixel. Nothing is tiled and nothing is
 * staged in shared memory, because each thread reads a handful of bytes and writes one value.
 *
 * WHY THIS AGREES WITH THE HOST BYTE FOR BYTE. Three properties hold it together. The value a thread
 * computes is integer arithmetic on the same inputs. No rounding can differ. The cell a thread
 * targets comes from integer division and a permutation, neither of which depends on which thread
 * runs. And the reduction is a minimum or a maximum, both associative and commutative. The
 * scheduler may interleave the atomics in any order and reach the same result. A reduction selecting
 * by arrival would have made the device answer depend on scheduling and could not have been graded
 * against the host at all.
 *
 * @note The transform and the channel are reimplemented here, because the host arm is built by
 *       MinGW through CMake and this is built by nvcc driving MSVC. The two cannot link, the same
 *       split utils/maint/engine/build_gpu_arm.sh already documents for the exact arm. Where a device is
 *       present, bench_raster grades the two rasters byte for byte, and a divergence fails a row.
 * @warning A copy is a defect waiting to happen, and this one is only safe because a grader compares
 *          the outputs on every configuration. Delete that grader and this file becomes a second
 *          renderer nobody checks.
