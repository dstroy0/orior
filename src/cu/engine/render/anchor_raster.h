 * @file anchor_raster.h
 * @brief Rasterizes the object under examination directly from engine state, on host or device.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * THE OBJECT UNDER EXAMINATION IS THE FIELD AND WHAT THE ENGINE SAW OF IT. A search over a corpus
 * produces one outcome per alignment: some probe rejected it, or every probe agreed and the full
 * compare decided it. That outcome sequence is already an image. One value per alignment, laid out
 * in corpus order, is a direct render of where the engine pruned and where it had to look harder.
 *
 * DIRECT, meaning the raster is built from the same state the search runs on, with no export step
 * and no second representation in between. A viewer that reads a dumped file is describing what was
 * written down; this describes what the engine did.
 *
 * WHAT A PIXEL CARRIES. The level at which an alignment died. Zero means the first probe rejected
 * it, one means the second did, and so on. An alignment that passed every probe carries the probe
 * count, and one that also matched under the full compare carries ANCHOR_RASTER_MATCH. Brighter is
 * later. A bright pixel is an alignment the probe set could not cheaply refute.
 *
 * HOST AND DEVICE PRODUCE THE SAME BYTES. That is the contract, and it is gradeable and not
 * aspirational: the raster is integer valued throughout. Agreement is exact and a difference of
 * one in one pixel is a defect. This is the same contract src/cu/types/integers/arm.h states for the arms, kept for
 * the same reason.
 *
 * @note Downsampling takes the MINIMUM death level over the alignments mapping to a pixel. Minimum
 *       is associative and commutative. A sequential host reduction and a parallel device one
 *       reach the same value without ordering agreeing between them. A rule like "first alignment
 *       wins" would make the device answer depend on scheduling.
 * @note No float anywhere. Positions map through integer division and values are counts.
 * @note Writes Netpbm P5, which needs no library and no encoder.

 *

 * render, and every proven pixel is still proven.
