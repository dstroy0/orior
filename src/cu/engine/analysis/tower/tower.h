// approximation coefficient at floor `floor` through `forward`, a permutation of [0, 1 << index_bits);
// the high bits pass through. The map is a bijection on the coefficient word and tower_lower replays
// its inverse in reverse order. This is the engine's nonlinear edge (kolmogorov_arnold.md) folded into
// the reversible tower: the tower keeps the crystal exactly invertible, the edge makes it universal over
// the coefficient alphabet. `floor` runs 0..floors: floor k acts on the approximation just before level
// k's lifting, and floor == floors acts on the fully collapsed floor.
