// The record program compiled. Nothing hand-written is linked with it: the language's own forms write every record
// operation into the lane and the resident kernel that runs the lanes after it (program_unit), and one text is the
// whole program. A program is written first as PTX (code_generator("ptx.krs")): each step unrolled at its widths into
// straight-line assembly over registers the lane holds, a step that loops on its values a loop of the same forms, and
// nvJitLink assembles and links it alone, with no compiler between. Where the lane cannot be written so, or its
// PTX does not build, the lane is C source instead (code_generator("c.krs")), the same lane in c.krs with its file and
// signs in the thread block's shared memory, file_limbs the most it holds live at once, compiled by NVRTC as
// relocatable code and linked alone the same way. A program of any length builds either way. A thread block holds as
// many threads as its shared memory fits of the C lane's places; a PTX lane takes none. The interpreter above stays the
// oracle, and the fallback for a program neither way builds, this process cannot load or shared memory cannot hold one
// thread's places for.
//
// The compiled program runs as a resident program with a block (EngineProgramBlock) in device memory. Its thread blocks
// take lanes a round at a time from one counter, check in to the block as they go, and leave once the launch has run
// its time to live or the block's command says to. The last one out writes where the program stands, and the run
// launches it again from there until every lane is done: a launch never outlives the display driver's watchdog, and no
// lane runs twice. The host reads the block only once a launch has ended. Eight switches, read at each load or run:
// CYCLE_RECORD_INTERPRET=1 keeps every program on the interpreter, CYCLE_RECORD_CHECK=1 runs both on every launch and
// errors on the launch where their records or errors differ, CYCLE_RECORD_REPORT=1 says on stderr where each program
// came from and how long each kernel ran, CYCLE_RECORD_TTL=<microseconds> sets a launch's time to live,
// CYCLE_RECORD_LTO=1 builds the programs as LTO-IR and links each with link-time optimization, which writes no PTX,
// CYCLE_RECORD_NVRTC=1 writes every lane as C source, and CYCLE_RECORD_HOST_C=1 writes it so and builds it with the
// host's compiler, to run on the host (cycle_compile.cu), and CYCLE_RECORD_KEEP_PTX=1 turns rule (i) off
// (cycle_record_route). No switch turns the device's writing off: the device writes each lane from its step table,
// and its text is held to the host code generator's (cycle_codegen_on_device), the assembly printer's own lane
// included: the assembly printer runs on the interpreter while it writes that one.
