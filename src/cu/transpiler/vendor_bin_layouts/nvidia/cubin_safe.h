#ifndef CUBIN_SAFE_H
#define CUBIN_SAFE_H

// A cubin the driver is handed runs as it is written. Machine code our own assembler wrote, or a probe turned one bit
// of, is read here first with our own reader against the machine file, and goes to the part only where every
// instruction it reaches holds to these, in order:
//
//   1. its scheduler's bits wait on all six barriers, and where no form holds the instruction, stall the longest. A
//      stall short of the soonest a result is read gives a wrong answer and never a kernel that does not return, and
//      the run channel asks below it to find where that soonest lies (sass_operation_schedule);
//   2. where a form of the machine file holds its encoding, that form neither transfers control nor waits
//      (sass_operation_control_or_wait), EXIT alone excepted;
//   3. where no form holds it, its operation key holds forms and no form under the key transfers control or waits.
//      Whatever its other bits say, it falls through to the next instruction. One instruction at most is held by no
//      form: the one a probe asks about;
//   4. an EXIT with no guard is reached: no thread runs off the end of the code;
//   5. an operation whose result is back in a fixed count of cycles sets no barrier, unless the encoding the system
//      wrote its form with sets one. Nothing releases one it sets, and the next instruction's wait on all six never
//      ends: the kernel never returns.
//
// The code is read from its first instruction to its first EXIT with no guard, and nothing past it is read, since
// nothing reaches it: the self branch and the padding after a kernel's last exit are never run. Nothing here changes
// the code.
