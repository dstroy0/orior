// or stops the instruction running is a bit the part reads; one that changes nothing is control or unused.

// Which operand a read bit belongs to is matched instead of guessed: the same instruction is run with each source operand's
// register number or number moved by a known amount, and a turned encoding bit belongs to the operand whose move
// gives the same answer. A read bit no operand's move explains is the operation's own, or a field the text does not
// print.
//
// Nothing is compiled and no disassembler is run. The cubins are written here and run by interface_sass_run, which
// loads each through the driver and answers over one case; a cubin the part refuses ends that runner, and this restarts
