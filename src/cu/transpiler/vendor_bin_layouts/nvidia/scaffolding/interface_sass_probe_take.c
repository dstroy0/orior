// interface_sass_probe_take.c: every instruction of a listing whose form the machine file lacks, taken into it with its
// fields.
//
// The forms are taken into a machine of their own, and their fields found by the probe's own reading: each form's 128
// bits turned over one at a time and decoded, the runs of bits that change one printed operand kept as that operand's
// (sass_machine_fields). Each is then put into the machine file with those runs and the file written again. A form
// the machine file already holds is left as it stands, its fields and its encoding untouched.
//
//     interface_sass_probe_take <listing> <machine file> <architecture> <folder>
//     interface_sass_probe_take --fields <machine file> <architecture> <folder>
//
// The second form gives every form the machine file holds its fields again by the probe's reading, prints each form
// whose fields that changes, and writes the file.
//
// The listing is what cuobjdump -sass or nvdisasm prints; the architecture is named as the disassembler names it,
// SM86; the folder holds the encodings the disassembler is given.
