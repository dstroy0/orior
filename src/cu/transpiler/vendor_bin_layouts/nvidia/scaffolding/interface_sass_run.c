// interface_sass_run.c: a list of cubins run on the part in one process, one answer a cubin. Nothing is compiled here:
// the driver is handed each cubin as it was written and asked for its kernel.
//
//     interface_sass_run [--held <file>] <machine file> <list> <first> <answers> [<cases> [<most>]]
//
// It joins the gate's safety airlock like the carrier: --held reads the vendor's verdict (cubin_safe_verdict_*), and a
// line reaches the part only with a verdict in hand, an encoding the verdict holds never reaching it. Given no verdict
// a line is held off the part, since code the vendor's reader never read for a fault can be the one that crashes the
// host.
//
// The list holds one cubin a line, as `<path> <kernel>`. Each from line `first` on is read on the host first and held
// to cubin_safe against the machine file; one that breaks a rule is never handed to the driver and adds `<number>
// skipped cubin_safe_<verdict>`. Every other is loaded, its kernel run over the
// probe's case, and a line `<number> answered <w0> <w1> <w2> <w3>` added to the answers file. Given a cases file, one
// case a line as up to eight words in hex, the kernel is run once over every case, a thread a case, and the line holds
// the first word of each case's answer in the file's order. Given `most`, a pass runs that many lines at most and
// ends with exit 4 where lines are left, which keeps a pass short enough for a cap on its time to bound one cubin.
// A cubin the part refuses
// kills the context past recovery: resetting the part's primary context in place leaves the next launch failing. A
// refusal adds `<number> refused <error>` and ends the process with exit 3, and the caller starts it again past that
// line. A pause after each launch keeps a run of launches from flooding the part and taking the display down with it.
// Exit 0 where every line ran, 2 where the list or the device was not reached.
