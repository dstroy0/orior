# The scheduler's bits NVIDIA's compiler writes

Written by `monolith_scheduler.sh` whole on every run. Every CUDA source of the tree is built by NVIDIA's compiler for one part, each cubin's code sections are read from the ELF, each instruction is named by our reader through the machine file and its bits 105 to 127 read through the fields the machine file names. No listing is read and no disassembler is run.

72 cubins, 96976 instructions, 7426 no form reads, 176 operations.

An operation's soonest read is the fewest cycles, its stalls summed, between it and the first instruction that reads the register it writes, over every place it sets no write barrier and no later one holds it. Readers waiting count the first readers of a register it writes with a write barrier where a wait on that barrier stands between the two, at the reader or before it, against those where none does. A barrier counts its producers, and a wait on it holds until all of them are back. Behind a later one counts the first readers of a register it writes with no barrier where a later instruction of the same operation sets one, waited on before the read. Behind an earlier one counts those where no later one does and an earlier instruction of the same operation sets one, waited on before the read, with the fewest cycles between that wait and the read. The machine file columns count the places whose form records a write barrier, and a read barrier, against the places a form was found.
