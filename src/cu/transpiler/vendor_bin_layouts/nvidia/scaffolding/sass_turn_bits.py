"""One 128-bit encoding and the 128 that are one bit from it, written as raw instructions for nvdisasm --binary.

    sass_turn_bits.py <low> <high> <binary> [--without <address>,<address>,...]

`low` and `high` are the instruction's two 64-bit words in hex, low first, as a listing prints them. The encoding
itself goes first. The disassembler's line at address 0 is then the form given, and the line at address 16*(bit+1)
is that form with bit `bit` turned over.

`--without` names, in hex, the addresses of encodings the disassembler refused. Each is written as a NOP instead of
being dropped, and every other encoding then keeps the address that says which bit it is. Their bits read as NOP,
and by that the caller tells a refused encoding from a decoded one.
