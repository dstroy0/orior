// A form is an operation with its modifiers and, for each printed operand, what kind of thing it is and the mark it
// carries (- or ~ on a register, ! on a predicate). Two instructions of one form differ only in the values their
// operand fields hold, and the encoding a form was first seen with is the base every instruction of that form is
// assembled from (sass_assemble.h).
//
// Which bits carry which operand is not guessed. The cell's probe turns each of the form's 128 bits over one at a
// time, disassembles all 129 encodings, and keeps the runs of bits that changed a printed operand; those runs are the
// form's fields. Matching an operand to a field by the value the base happens to hold there is not enough, because a
// field the operation does not use holds 0 and a register or predicate numbered 0 matches it.
//
// A part's own file is <part>.khw beside its rulesets (src/cu/types/file_defs/khw). Its first line is `forms 1`, then
// `part <name>`, then a line a form:
//
//     form <operation> <kind><mark>,... <low> <high> <operand>:<first>-<last>;... <the instruction it was seen as>
//
// where <low> and <high> are the instruction's two 64-bit words in hex, low first, as a listing prints them, and the
// runs are the bits that change each operand, by the operand's place in the printed text.
