// Every arrangement of primitives that produces a relation.
//
// An operator is a chain, and a chain can be rearranged. A person writing a compiler affords one arrangement for
// each operator, because a person has to write it. Nobody writes these. Every arrangement that works is kept and a
// job takes the one that suits it. What separates the arrangements is cost, and cost is measured on the target.
// Finding them is this file's part of it.
//
// A chain is kept when it answers every case of the relation. The cases are arithmetic and the chain is run over
// them here, with no target involved: a chain that fails a case is wrong everywhere, and there is no reason to ask a
// target about it. A chain that passes is a candidate the target may or may not be able to write.
