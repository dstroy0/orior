// Asks put from inside the interface, at addresses nothing has said are safe.

// An address that refuses a read or a put ends the process that asked, and from inside one process that ending is
// the last thing learned. The interface runs the asks in a probe it can lose: a walk of addresses goes to `query_walk`,
// which answers each address in turn until one ends it, and the ending is that address's answer. The walk is put
// again from the next address, in a fresh probe, until every address has an answer. Nothing is asked of a system
// about what lies at an address: the address is asked, and it answers, holds, reads as a word, advances or ends the
// asker.
