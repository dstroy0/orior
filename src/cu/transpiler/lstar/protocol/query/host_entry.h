//   put   a word at an address
//   read  a word at an address
//
// A store and a load. There is nothing under them and nothing between them and the part: no system is asked for
// permission, no library is called, and no header of anybody's is included. This file includes nothing at all. A
// compiler that has to be given an address and a word can be given them anywhere.
//
// A bus is any bus because a bus is these two. A window at an address is one writing of them, a serial line
// clocking bits is another, a fabric's aperture a third; each is a few stores and loads at the addresses that drive
// it, and each is found the same way as anything else here.
//
// What is on the bus is not a third relation. It is these two put to the bus's own addresses: read the word a part
// answers with, and read nothing where no part answers. Asking a system what it carries gets that system's opinion
// of what it carries, which puts a third party in the loop, and its opinion is not the part's answer. The bus says
// what is on it because the bus is asked.
//
// What an entry is not is a translator. A thing that turns a source into a coding is the part of the loop being
// derived, and a word that went through one is that translator's answer and not the host's.
