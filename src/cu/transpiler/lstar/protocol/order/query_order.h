// The known order of asks put through the query protocol: links that are asks, costs read off a clock that is an
// address, and every link's cost solved from the order's answers.
//
// A link is one ask, an address and a qualifier. Ask r of the known order puts every link it covers, `repeat` times
// over, between two reads of the clock, and its cost is the clock's advance across them. A clock that steps far less
// often than an ask takes reads a single ask as a step or nothing, and `repeat` makes one ask of the order
// last many steps. The order's asks are put in turn, `passes` times over: a drift in the part's speed falls on
// every ask alike. Every pass's answers are kept, ask_order_solve gives every link's cost pass by pass, and the spread
// across passes is the noise floor, read off the answers. ask_links_read says whether the links add or contend. Nothing here holds a floating point value.
