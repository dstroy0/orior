// What the compiler knows before it has met anything: relations.
//
// A relation is a tuple of words and the word that goes with them. 1,1 -> 2 is a relation. It is not an addition,
// because addition is a writing and this file holds none. Every system that computes at all agrees about 1,1 -> 2.
// Nothing else can be assumed about a system nobody has met. Arithmetic is the shared ground; the
// writing that reaches it is the part that differs, and finding that writing is the compiler's work.
//
// The names below are coherence anchors. That is all they are: they let the compiler say which relations it has
// found a writing for and compose them into larger ones. A target is never told a name and never asked about one.
//
// Two anchors are required. A system that holds SAME and ADD can be given the rest: TAKE is ADD over a
// complement, PRODUCT is UP and ADD stacked, and the gates reach one another through rewrites. A system that holds
// neither cannot be spoken to.

// The anchors, the relations that fix each one, how many words a question of it carries, and whether its answer is
// a function of those words. The relations are written as cases and not as formulas, for one reason: a case is a
// thing a target can be asked, and a formula is not.
//
// The last column separates the two kinds of question on the ladder. A relation's answer follows from the words it
// was put with, the same way on every system that has the relation at all. A chain of primitives can be found for
// it and checked before any system is asked. A measure's answer follows from the system: how many places a word
// holds is true of the part and of nothing else, no chain produces it, and the only way to it is to ask. Handing a
// measure to a chain builder gets arrangements that hit the one answer by accident.
