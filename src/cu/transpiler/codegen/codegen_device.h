// The code generator on the device (engine_table.md item 11(a)): a program's lane written by the device from its
// step table, with no text written on the host. The device lays out what each step reads from outside itself, decides
// each step's forms a thread a step (codegen_core.h), counted and then written where a scan of the counts puts them,
// decides the lane's own forms in one thread, lays out the forms as the assembly printer's records (asm_printer.h),
// runs the text program on the record machine, a lane a byte, and gathers the bytes that are not 0 into the text. The
// host lays out once what is the ruleset's, the target's and the header's alone (asm_printer_ruleset_build), and reads
// back the counts that size the device's memory and the text. A lane a language clocks is split into states on the
// device as well (codegen_device_instrs), in one thread, since each state goes on from the one before. The device's
// text is the host's (CodeGenerator::decided, written by asm_printer_host) byte for byte: the forms are the core's on
// both, and the assembly printer writes what the ruleset's text would.
//
// The step table itself is laid out on the device as well, from the program's steps: keymath's encoding
// (keymath_core.h) and key_schedule's layout (key_schedule_core.h), each in one thread, since each step reads the steps
// before it, the one keymath_record_encode and key_schedule_record_layout run on the host. The assembly printer is laid
// out there too, from what asm_printer_ruleset_build kept of it, and checked against the host's layout word for word
// before the record machine loads it
