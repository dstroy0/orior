// The alphabet. Storing ops as a binary tree of primitives is the most lightweight you can make a language. The floor
// of universal operations, and what every math function is built out of, are quoted whole in
// src/engine_plan.md under The precepts; this file is that floor written down.
//
// Every operation the compiler decides is a binary tree whose leaves are operands and whose nodes are the precepts
// below. Nothing here comes apart further: each is a gate, a wire or a branch, and a target that lacks one of these
// lacks the means to be compiled to at all. Everything above this file - a multiply, a divide, a comparison, a
// carry chain - is a tree over these and carries no new primitive. A target's ruleset says which subtrees it has a
// single instruction for; the clock says which of those are worth taking. The alphabet itself is ours and no
// target's: it is the irreducible set, and a part is never asked whether it agrees with it.
//
// The arity is how many children a node takes. No precept takes three, and the tree is binary for that reason.
