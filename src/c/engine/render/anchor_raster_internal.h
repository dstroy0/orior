 * WHY THIS IS FAST, AND IT IS THE SAME REASON THE SEARCH IS. A pixel costs what the alignment under
 * it costs, and a steered probe set rejects most alignments on the first read. The renderer gets the
 * same saving: driving reads per alignment toward one drives the cost of a frame toward one read
 * per alignment. Nothing here is optimized separately from the search, and there is no second code
 * path to keep in agreement with it.
