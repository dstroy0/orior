 * @file scan_neon.c
 * @brief The steering scan under NEON, sixteen alignments per compare.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * THE SAME QUESTION AVX2 ANSWERS, ONE ARM OVER. Held at one needle offset, does
 * `corpus[at + offset]` equal `needle[offset]` for consecutive `at`. The needle byte broadcasts
 * once, the corpus side is a sliding window at unit stride, and the survivor mask enters as the
 * alignments still standing. A NEON register is 128 bits and answers sixteen of those in one compare.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARM IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO. It returns the portable arm's count or it has a defect. The
 * value is an integer count of alignments and the two arms agree exactly or one is wrong. That is
 * the contract AnchorSteerEngine carries, the same one the exact arms carry in src/c/types/integers/arm.h.
 *
 * @note Written for the Raspberry Pi 5, a Cortex-A76 at aarch64. This arm runs and its name has
 *       no unrun tag. NEON is mandatory in the base aarch64 architecture. A build that reached
 *       here can always run it and there is nothing to detect.
 * @note There is no movemask on NEON. A byte compare sets a lane to all ones where it agrees, the
 *       alive lanes enter the same way, and the count is taken by shifting each surviving lane down
 *       to one and adding the sixteen lanes across the register. The across-vector add is an aarch64
 *       form, the architecture this arm targets.
 * @note The tail below sixteen is finished scalar, the same code the portable arm runs.
