 * @file scan.c
 * @brief The steering scan in portable C11, the reference every other scan arm is graded against.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * ONE PRIMITIVE. Held at one needle offset, count the alignments still standing whose corpus byte at
 * that offset equals the needle byte the level is testing. That is the operation a planner asks
 * of a scan engine, and it is the same question every wide arm answers faster.
 *
 * @note THE REFERENCE. This arm uses no intrinsic and no compiler extension. It builds anywhere a
 *       C11 compiler runs, and every other scan arm returns the same count or has a defect. That is
 *       the contract AnchorSteerEngine carries, the same one the exact arms carry in src/c/types/integers/arm.h.
 * @note It counts a scan call and never a wide call. anchor_steer_scan_calls and
 *       anchor_steer_wide_calls are defined in orior_steer_count.c and declared in the header; a wide arm
 *       counts both. Wide over total is the share served on the vector path.
