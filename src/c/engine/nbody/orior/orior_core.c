 * @return               How many alignments match exactly.
 * @note Only this engine takes a count. The free order engine's advantage is that its comparisons
 *       are written out and fold into one value with one branch behind them, and a loop over a
 *       runtime count gives that back. A corpus whose count wants reducing is a coherent one, and
 *       a coherent corpus dispatches here anyway.
 * @note A needle of length zero occurs at every alignment, and the naive engine returns
 *       that count. That case is handed to it and not answered a second way here. An anchor
 *       cannot be placed in a needle with no bytes, and bounding the offsets is not enough on its
 *       own: at length zero the alignment loop runs one further than the corpus. The last
 *       alignment reads one past its end, and the anchor reads element zero of a needle that has
 *       none. Both are reads outside memory the caller owns.
