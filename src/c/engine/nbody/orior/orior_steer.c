 * Truthy and falsy steering. The signal is the survivor vector, not the symbol histogram.
 *
 * EACH PERMUTATION OF THE ANCHORS IS A NULL, AND EACH NULL IS A STEER. An alignment survives only
 * when every anchor agrees, and a conjunction does not depend on the order of its terms. Every
 * ordering of a given anchor set returns the same count. The orderings therefore form a group of
 * moves that CANNOT change the answer, called a null in this tree. Steering is choosing
 * which element of that group to apply.
 *
 * The safety argument for everything below rests on this alone, and it is structural and not
 * defensive. A planner that samples badly, ranks wrongly, or is outright broken still lands on some
 * element of the null group, and every element yields the same count. The planner moves inside the
 * null and the null has one value. Correctness is therefore not something the planner can spend,
 * and speed is the only currency it holds.
