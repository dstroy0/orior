/**
 * @file scan_sve.c
 * @brief The steering scan under SVE, at whatever vector length the part turns out to have.
 * @author dstroy0 (Douglas Quigg) <dquigg123@gmail.com>
 *
 * THE SAME QUESTION AVX2 ANSWERS, WITHOUT A FIXED WIDTH. Held at one needle offset, does
 * `corpus[at + offset]` equal `needle[offset]` for consecutive `at`. The needle byte broadcasts
 * once, the corpus side is a sliding window at unit stride, and the survivor mask enters as the
 * alignments still standing. SVE answers a vector's worth of those per compare, and the vector is
 * as wide as the part.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARM IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO. It returns the portable arm's count or it has a defect. The
 * value is an integer count of alignments and the two arms agree exactly or one is wrong. That is
 * the contract AnchorSteerEngine carries, the same one the exact arms carry in src/c/types/integers/arm.h.
 *
 * @note No part in this project has SVE. The Raspberry Pi 5 is a Cortex-A76, NEON only. This arm
 *       has never been run. It is compiled for armv8.2-a+sve and its emitted instructions are read by
 *       utils/maint/engine/verify_arm_asm.sh, which confirms the predicated forms. That rules out a scalar
 *       fallback. It says nothing about behavior, and the name reads sve-unrun for that reason.
 * @note SVE has no fixed vector length. svcntb() answers how many byte lanes this part carries and
 *       the loop is written around a predicate. No lane count appears here and the tail needs no
 *       separate scalar loop: svwhilelt_b8 covers only the lanes that exist and the count comes from
 *       svcntp_b8 over the surviving predicate.
 * @note Detection reads the hardware capability word Linux exposes, never executing an SVE
 *       instruction to see whether it faults. There is no cpuid on ARM: a part's features come from
 *       the kernel, and on anything other than Linux this arm reports itself absent instead of
 *       guessing.
