// One emitter, every container. It reads a layout file and writes what that layout describes.
//
// There is no emitter for one format and another for the next. The work is the same wherever code has to be handed
// to a system: take a container that system already accepts, put the code in, put in the few attributes the code
// decides, and lay the parts out again. Which byte holds the count of sections, what an attribute's tag is, what
// the code's part is called - all of that is rows in a file (container_layout.h, emit/layouts/).
//
// A pattern is a container the target already accepted. Everything in it the emitter does not understand is
// carried over and never invented. A partly known layout is therefore enough to work with: the rows that are
// known say what to change, and the rest of the bytes travel untouched.
