#define FLOOR_TRACK_INTERNAL_H

// Floor 2 matched across frames. Every frame's floor 2 is the
// engine's, the crystal's 16^3 corner lowered as its own tower, checked against the host's two-level lifting, and laid
// out once as 16 bit planes. A body's signature is its patch of floor-2 values in frame t: its own cell alone, or the
// 27 cells around it. The later frame is searched whole with no value read: each patch cell's range [v - d, v + d] is
// taken on the planes by ands and ors alone, shifted to the patch center, and the patch's masks anded, a word stopping
// once it is empty. The expected answer is each body's own path. A control moves every body exactly one floor-2 cell a
// frame with no noise and no ramp. Floor 2 translates exactly and a tolerance of 0 must find every body. The camera law
// then moves bodies a voxel a frame under shot and read noise. From frame t to t + 1 that is a quarter of a floor-2
// cell, and the decimated floor is not shift-invariant under it; from t to t + 4, floor 2's own time step, it is a
// whole cell again. The 27 cells read the samples within 10 of the body's cell. A body another body reaches there does
// not translate alone: the camera law's bodies are run again with no noise, and three of them are set apart along z,
// with the noise and without it, where every step is clear and a tolerance of 0 must find every one. The hits, the
// false candidates and the plane words read are counted at every tolerance. Every candidate set is held to the
// host's scan.
