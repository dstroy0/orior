// Finding x on a's floor 2 for less than half of a. a is one camera-law frame of n samples. The engine's tower lifts it,
// and floor 2
// is the approximation after two levels: the 16^3 corner, m = n / 64 values, read from the engine by lowering that
// corner as its own tower and checked against the host's own two-level lifting. Floor 2's values are laid out once as
// 16 bit planes. A query x then reads no value at all: the positions holding x are the and, over the planes, of each
// plane where x's bit is 1 and its complement where it is 0, 32 positions a word, and a word stops being read once its
// mask is empty. Every match set is checked against the host's scan of floor 2, for values on floor 2 and values not on
// it, and every query's reads are counted against n / 2. The index is built once: the lift reads a's n samples and the
// planes floor 2's m values, and every query after reads only plane words.
