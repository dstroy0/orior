//
// Chaitin's halting probability for Tromp's binary lambda calculus, bracketed exactly.
//
// The machine reads a closed lambda term from its input, self-delimited in de Bruijn form (00 M is
// lambda M, 01 M N is M applied to N, 1^k 0 is the variable bound k lambdas out), and halts where the
// term has a normal form. The codes are prefix free. Omega = sum of 2^-|t| over the halting terms
// is a probability. Its first n bits settle the halting of every program of n bits or fewer, and
// no machine therefore computes them all: Omega is approached from below and never reached.
//
// Every closed term of at most L bits is run by normal order reduction, which reaches a normal form
// whenever one exists. Reaching one proves the halt. A watcher holding a copy of the term at each
// power of two steps (Brent) sees every bit of it, and a term that comes back to a state it held
// is proven never to halt. Held to a bounded space, a term can only halt or repeat, since the space holds
// finitely many terms; so the runs are split by exit: halted, looped, out of steps (the space not yet
// searched), and outgrew the space, the one exit no bounded search closes. A grower is closed where it
// is proven to grow forever: a part of it returns at its own head (omega_grows_forever).
//
// The runs go to the device, one term to a thread, with the host running the few that pass the device's small
// budgets (omega_device); the host's own run of every term through 30 bits must give the same fates and busy
// beavers. Arguments: L, steps, tokens, and "cpu" to run every term on the host instead.
//
// The mass of the closed terms longer than L is bounded by counting, not running: the mass a(n) of
// every term code of n bits and the mass c(n, k) of those closed under k lambdas follow recurrences,
// summed in fixed point rounded toward the bound each side needs. Every code parses to its end with
// probability 1 (the parse is a subcritical branching process, and 1 is the smaller root of
// T^2 - 3T + 2 = 0). What the counted lengths leave of 1 bounds every longer length at once.
//
//   Omega >= the halted mass,
//   Omega <= the halted mass + the open mass + the closed mass past L,
//
// both exact dyadics, and each bit the two share is a bit of Omega.

// The run by the engine: every normal order step of every live term is one sweep of the engine's record machine,
// and nothing bounds it but the machine. A term is as many records as it has tokens. It grows by adding records
// and no register or field holds a whole term. The live terms stay on the device from admission to their fate. Each
// round, a thread a term finds its leftmost redex and lays out where every token of the reduct comes from: the
// prefix and the suffix copied, the body's tokens with the depth they sit at, and a copy of the argument for each
// variable the redex's lambda binds, with the depth it is put under and the lambdas above each of its tokens. The
// record machine gathers each source token through its index list and computes the reduct's token: a body variable
// bound past the redex moves in by one, an argument's variable bound outside it moves out by the depth, and the
// rest are copied. The record program is encoded for the widths the round's values need. No width is set
// anywhere. A thread a term then takes the same decisions as omega_run, in the same order: a normal form halts,
// Brent's watcher proves a loop, and omega_grows_forever's proof is made on the new term. Only a settled term
// leaves the device, as one record. There is no step budget and no token budget: a term runs until one of those
// settles it. A term the device's memory cannot hold for its next round is parked as outgrown, the only
// exit left open, and a stop leaves every live term open. The run is one tessera job.
