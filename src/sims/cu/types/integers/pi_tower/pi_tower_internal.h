#ifndef PI_TOWER_INTERNAL_H
#define PI_TOWER_INTERNAL_H

// Pi turning at the boundary, and the tower it builds.
// The boundary is the circle of length 1 and the turn is x -> x + pi, which on the circle is the rotation by
// alpha = pi - 3. The turn never closes. It never lands where it has been. Its returns near the start are its
// floors: the return map to the arc under a close return is again a rotation, by the Gauss map's angle, and the
// counts of turns on each floor are pi's partial quotients [3; 7, 15, 1, 292, ...] (H. Weyl, 1916; V. T. Sos, 1958,
// the three gap theorem; T. van Ravenstein, "The three gap theorem (Steinhaus conjecture)", J. Austral. Math. Soc. A
// 45, 1988). Cut the boundary into N = 2^k cells: the turn fills every cell at an exact step, and that step and the
// cell it fills are read here from the floors, without walking the turn.
// Everything is exact. pi is bracketed by Machin's formula in integers, and the turn is held as the integer rotation
// y_n = n A mod 2^P, A = floor(alpha 2^P). A first hit, the least n with y_n in a window, is Euclid's descent through
// the floors. Whether the integer turn is the real one, cell for cell, is itself a first hit, and is checked.
// 1. pi is bracketed: floor(pi 2^P) is one integer at both ends of Machin's bracket, and its first 64 bits after the
//    point are the published 0x243F6A8885A308D3.
// 2. The floors: pi's partial quotients, certified by the bracket, begin 7, 15, 1, 292, ... as published.
// 3. The turn's closest returns are the floors: the steps at which the turn comes nearer its start than ever before
//    are exactly the convergents' denominators q_j, every one up to 2^PI_TOWER_RECORD_BITS.
// 4. The integer turn is the real turn: at every resolution no step up to the one searched lands in a cell other
//    than the real one.
// 5. The step that fills the boundary, read from the floors, equals a walk of every step, at 2^1 to 2^PI_TOWER_WALK_MAX
//    cells, and so does the last cell filled.
// 6. At every resolution asked for, the last cell filled is first touched at that step.
// The resolutions come with the request: pi_tower [n] reads 2^n alone, pi_tower [from] [to] reads 2^from to 2^to, and
// no argument reads 2^1 to 2^100.
// The precision follows the largest, P = 3 n + 64 bits rounded up to a word and at least PI_TOWER_BITS, and a build
// whose exact width cannot hold 3 (P + PI_TOWER_GUARD) + 64 bits errors on it by name (SIM_EXACT_LIMBS sets the width).
// The arc. Roll the boundary into a cylinder whose cross-section is our disk: the turn is the helix of radius 1 / (2
// pi) rising 1 / pi a turn, and it pierces our disk at the marks {n pi}. Its bending plane stands at the angle
// phi = arctan(1 / pi) to our disk, and the ratio of its torsion to its curvature is tan phi (Lancret, 1806).
// 7. In Q(pi), where pi is a free variable because it is transcendental (Lindemann, 1882), the helix's Frenet frame
//    taken from its derivatives at the four quarter turns gives curvature 2 pi^3 / (pi^2 + 1), torsion
//    2 pi^2 / (pi^2 + 1), tau / kappa = 1 / pi = tan phi, and a Darboux vector tau T + kappa B along our disk's axis.
// 8. The same numbers from the bracket: kappa, tau and phi in degrees, each printed only where both ends agree.
// The balance and the boundary.
// 9. On the helix the pull points at our axis. The torque about it is zero, and the angular momentum about it at
//    unit speed is L_z^2 = 1 / (4 (pi^2 + 1)) at all four quarter turns, in Q(pi); L_z from the bracket to 12 places.
// 10. The billiard in the unit square from the corner at slope pi, unfolded: the segment in lattice cell (i, j) carries
//    L = (-1)^(i + j) ((j + 1/2) - pi (i + 1/2)) about the square's center, with p = (1, pi). L = 0 would need
//    pi = (2j + 1) / (2i + 1), and a corner would need pi (i + 1) whole: each tie is pi rational. Walked from the
//    integer turn over 2^PI_TOWER_BILLIARD_BITS columns, every floor decided with the turn's certainty: no wall hit is
//    a corner, no segment's L is zero, and the walk's record near-corners are exactly the q_j. Measured: how often the
//    lead changes hands, the longest lead, each side's share, and the nearest tie.
// 11. The residue: on every floor with q_j to 2^PI_TOWER_RESIDUE_BITS, pi's first q_j steps have the whole parts of the
//    permutation n -> n p_j mod q_j, and at step q_j pi stands delta_j = q_j pi - (3 q_j + p_j) off the whole.
// 12. The golden helix: the residues flip sign every floor, q_j >= F_(j+1), |delta_j| < 1 / q_(j+1), and the shrink
//    |delta_j| / |delta_(j-1)| is above 1/2 exactly where a_(j+1) = 1. Measured: each shrink against the golden 1/phi,
//    and the growth a floor q_J^(1/J) against phi.
// The tower's deepest turns, on the engine. The turn at depth n is bit n of alpha, pi's fraction, and the BBP
// formula (D. H. Bailey, P. B. Borwein and S. Plouffe, Math. Comp. 66, 1997) reads it where it stands, without the bits
// before it: {16^d pi} = {4 S_1 - 2 S_4 - S_5 - S_6}, S_j = sum over i of 16^(d - i) / (8 i + j). Each term is a lane
// of the engine's record machine, its power shrunk mod 8 i + j at every square; keymath sizes every register, the
// scheduler lays them out, and tessera admits the job.
// 13. On the engine, pi's first 64 bits after the point are 0x243F6A8885A308D3, and its hex digits at Bailey's
//     published positions are his.
// 14. The engine's cell at the deepest resolution asked for, its low 64 bits, is the exact turn's.
// A resolution past 2^20, n given whole or as base^exponent (10^100 for a googol), is held as (2, n): its precision
// and widths are printed exact, and the engine sums the depth-n terms sweep by sweep, printing the terms done and its
// rate. Its digits are printed only once every term is summed.
// 15. A segment: pi_tower segment d [digits], d whole or base^exponent, reads that many hex digits from position d + 1
//     as windows at d, d + 20, d + 40, ..., each its own run on the engine. Every window certifies at least 24 digits,
//     the 4 or more it certifies past the 20 it gives are the next window's first (D. H. Bailey, "The BBP Algorithm
//     for Pi", 2006: a result at position d is checked by repeating it at d - 1 or d + 1), and where the segment starts
//     at one of Bailey's published positions its head is his.
