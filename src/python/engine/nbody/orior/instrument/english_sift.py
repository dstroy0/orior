# Every reader in this directory was written against one paper's layout, and each one cost a day of

# one each.
#
# Douglas put it the other way round: run the algorithm with English as the target, and the thing
# you are sifting for is the noise. That inverts the problem into the half that is well resourced.
# Nobody has to know Nsyilxcən or Lushootseed to find it. What has to be known is English, and a
# line that English does not account for is the language, a page number, or a gloss label, and
# those three are told apart by shape, never by vocabulary.
#
# The measure is the same one orior-method.md describes, in its cheapest form. A line is squashed
# to the byte pairs it contains, k = 256*b_i + b_(i+1), which is a flat index over 2^16 and takes
# no decision about characters at all. That helps here: half the trouble in this directory came
# from fonts that wrote ə as @ and ʔ as P, and a byte pair does not care what a glyph was meant to
# be. Each pair is scored against how often English uses it, and the line's score is the mean
# surprise across its pairs.
#
# The reference is built from the English already sitting in the extracted corpora: the translation
# and gloss lines, which nine readers have already marked as English. That is in-domain English,
# out of the same PDF pipeline, carrying the same typography and the same extraction damage as the
# lines being scored. A reference taken from ordinary prose would differ from the input for reasons
# that have nothing to do with language.
