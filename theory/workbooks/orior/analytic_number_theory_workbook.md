# Analytic number theory workbook

**Purpose:** Record what the engine's exact arithmetic shows when it is pointed at analytic number
theory, one poke at a time, claiming nothing. **Scope:** `examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_values.py`,
`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_zeros.py`, `examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_gram.py`,
`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_riemann_siegel.py`, `examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_arrival.py`,
`evidence/proofs/posits/proof_set_theory.py`, and this file.

This is a workbook, and it claims no result. It follows the rail the
millennium research paper set down (`theory/theory/millennium/chapters/chapter_what_this_is.tex`), because that
research paper already refused the exact temptation this one has to refuse:

- Claim nothing. No open problem is attacked here. A method that led a research paper would already claim to
  reach something; nothing of that kind is claimed or supported.
- Cite nothing unread. A fact that arrived by report says so in the sentence carrying it.
- Gaps go in the sentence making the claim, not in a footnote.
- Withdrawn entries stay on the page with whatever killed them.
- Draw the bar, never derive it. A threshold reasoned out of a distribution inherits every variance
  source it forgot.

What this workbook has that a pen-and-paper one lacks is exact arithmetic: every number below is
carried with no rounding, and checked by a second route. That buys verification to any number of
places. It does not buy a proof, and the difference is the reason for the rail above.

## Entry 1, 2026-09-16: zeta at the even integers

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_values.py`, run and exit 0. It computes the Riemann zeta function
at the even integers, `zeta(2k) = c_k * pi^(2k)`, with `c_k` an exact rational from the Bernoulli
numbers, and checks the values a second way that never touches `pi`.

- The values: `zeta(2) = 1.644934...`, `zeta(4) = 1.082323...`, up to `zeta(16)`, with coefficients
  `1/6, 1/90, 1/945, 1/9450, 1/93555, 691/638512875, 2/18243225, 3617/325641566250`. `pi` is computed
  to 80 places by Machin's formula and by Euler's, and they agree.
- The second route: Euler's convolution identity, `sum_{j=1}^{k-1} zeta(2j) zeta(2k-2j) =
(k + 1/2) zeta(2k)`. Every term carries `pi^(2k)`. The factor cancels and the identity is an exact
  rational statement about the `c_k`, derived a different way than the Bernoulli formula. It holds on
  the computed coefficients. A wrong coefficient, `zeta(4) = pi^4/80` in place of `/90`, breaks it, the
  drawn null.
- Prior art: the closed form for `zeta(2k)` is Euler's, eighteenth century, and standard. This file
  reproduces the values in exact integers and verifies them by the convolution identity; it does not
  originate them.

**What this is and is not.** These are the VALUES of zeta at the even integers. The Riemann hypothesis
is a statement about the ZEROS of `zeta(s)` in the critical strip, and no zero is computed or touched
here. Nothing in this entry bears on it.

## Entry 2, 2026-09-16: the set the values live in

`evidence/proofs/posits/proof_set_theory.py`, run and exit 0. It proves, by construction, four standard
facts and connects them to the measurement floor.

- The generation operator is a Moore closure: extensive, monotone, idempotent, with closed sets closed
  under intersection. One round of derivation is extensive and monotone but not idempotent, the null;
  a closure is the fixed point.
- The exactly-nameable quantities are countable: a finite description over a finite alphabet lands at a
  finite index, and the enumeration is shown injective and a contiguous prefix of the naturals on a
  sample.
- The reals are not countable: Cantor's diagonal builds, from any finite table, a real differing from
  every row.
- A countable set has measure zero: it is covered by intervals of total length below any `epsilon`,
  while the unit interval is not.
- Prior art: Cantor 1891 for the diagonal, Turing 1936 for the computable reals being a countable
  subset, and the standard result that the computable reals have measure zero. Reported from a web
  search, not from the primary papers, which are unread here; the constructions are reproduced and
  verified in the file. The file stands on the reproduction, and the citation carries none of its weight.

**The connection, stated carefully.** A zeta value at an even integer is `c_k * pi^(2k)`, an exactly
nameable number, one point in the countable set. A measured quantity is a real the engine can only
bracket to its deposit, and almost every real has no finite description. It lies in the uncountable
complement. The measurement floor of the precision document is that boundary. This is an observation
about where exact and measured quantities sit, and it makes no claim about any open problem.

## Entry 3, 2026-09-16: the symmetry of the zeros, and a dream kept in its column

`examples/0_experimental/zeta_zero_symmetry.py`, run and exit 0. What is proven and what is dreamed are
kept in separate columns here, by design.

PROVEN, exactly. The zero set is invariant under a Klein four-group: the functional equation's
involution `s -> 1 - s`, conjugation `s -> conj(s)`, and their composition `s -> 1 - conj(s)`, whose
fixed set is the critical line `Re(s) = 1/2`. On Gaussian rationals the file verifies the three
maps are involutions, the group closes, the fixed set is the critical line, and an orbit on the line
collapses from four points to a conjugate pair. This is the same shape as the transform's wave inversion
one level down: an involution and the fixed set it turns around, `m -> -m` fixing `0` and `n/2`, and
`s -> 1 - conj(s)` fixing the critical line. The two symmetries are theorems, the functional equation
and the real coefficients; the file verifies only the group they generate, which needs no zero.

DREAMED, and left as a dream. The zeros carry a fine structure that looks universal: rescaled by the
local mean spacing, their pair correlation matches the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble of random Hermitian
matrices. Montgomery conjectured it in 1973, Dyson recognized the GUE form on sight, and Odlyzko gave it
strong numerical support at heights near `10^20`. The DENSITY is a theorem, the Riemann-von Mangoldt
count `N(T) ~ (T / 2pi) log(T / 2pi) - T / 2pi`. That the distribution is exactly that one universal
form, and that every zero is a fixed point of `s -> 1 - conj(s)`, the Riemann hypothesis itself, is a
conjecture with strong numerical support and no proof. It is fun to dream that a single fingerprint
forces it. The dream is not a proof, and it stays in this column labeled a dream. Proof is proof. Prior
art: Montgomery 1973, Dyson, Odlyzko; reported from a web search, papers unread.

## Entry 4, 2026-10-02: the zeros, counted and placed by truthy and falsy verdicts

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_zeros.py`, run and exit 0. It computes zeta in the critical strip
as exact integers at a count of decimal places, the form `representation.exact` holds. pi comes from
`representation.constants.naturals`, where Machin's and Euler's identities agree, and `ln n` from two
series that agree the same way. A value is the floor at its places, every reading of it carries the
unit of its last place, and a value asked past the scale raises `WillNotFit`. Nothing rounds.

- The verdicts. Every verdict is a field, zero false and nonzero true, and a pass writes its verdicts
  for the next pass to read. Each point carries four: whether two Euler-Maclaurin routes, at `N` and
  `2N`, agree at its places, and the signs of `Re zeta`, `Im zeta` and `|Re zeta| - |Im zeta|`. Routes
  that disagree double `N`. A sign of zero doubles the places. The three signs give the eighth of a
  turn zeta sits in. No precision, region, step or term count is assigned.
- The count. Around a closed path the eighth turns sum to eight times the zeros inside it, by the
  argument principle. Each edge is read end to end and through its midpoint, and each half carries
  `COMPARE` of the smaller `|zeta|^2` at its ends against its chord `|zeta(c) - zeta(a)|^2`, at one
  count of places, and at each end `COMPARE` of `|zeta|^2` against `|zeta'|^2` times the step squared.
  Ends at different places are asked again at the deeper one, and a verdict of zero doubles the
  places. Readings that disagree, or a negative verdict, put the midpoint into the path. An edge is
  decided where the readings agree and every verdict is positive. Each value is read toward zero, its
  sign times the floor of its size. A floor is monotone, and a nonzero `COMPARE` of two sizes read
  this way is their order.
- The line. Every box is symmetric about `Re(s) = 1/2`. By the group entry 3 verifies, a zero off the
  line brings its mirror into the same box, and a symmetric box counting one holds a zero on the line.
- The walk. Up the strip from `t = 1`, between its own edges `Re(s) = 0` and `Re(s) = 1`: an empty box
  doubles the step, a crowded box splits into halves, and a box counting one is a zero. Each zero is
  then placed by sixteen bits, one pass per bit, in squares centred on the line.
- Positive control, with an answer from outside. `zeta(2)` equals `pi^2/6` at thirty places. Below
  `t = 123` the walk finds forty zeros, as Odlyzko's table `zeros1` has them, and each placed bracket
  holds the ordinate the table prints for it at nine places, read through
  `representation.exact.units`: `14.134725142` lies in `[14.13464355, 14.13476562]`, and
  `122.946829294` in `[122.94682312, 122.94683837]`. The run asks 56,570 values, the deepest point at
  sixteen places and the widest at `N = 64`, in five minutes on the host.
- Drawn null. With the integral of the rest, `N^(1-s)/(s-1)`, left out of both routes, the gap between
  them at `s = 1/2 + 20i` grows as `N` doubles, and no point is decided. With it, the routes agree at
  `N = 8`.
- The quadrant alone. Read by the signs of `Re` and `Im` only, without the magnitude sign and the
  chord, the walk counts the boxes `[24, 32]` and `[32, 40]` empty, where each holds two zeros. On
  `Re(s) = 0` zeta turns nearly once between two samples, and the shorter way round reads it backwards.
- The chord alone. Without the step verdict the box `[98, 102]` counts empty, where it holds two. Its
  edge on `Re(s) = 0` settles on three points while zeta turns nearly once between each pair, and the
  chords between values that land almost where they began are short. The derivative sees the turning.
- What it is not. Ten zeros on the line below `t = 50` is a computation at a height, and the field has
  verified far past it. It bears on the Riemann hypothesis exactly as far as every verification below a
  height does, and not at all past that height.

## Entry 5, 2026-10-02: the Gram points, and Gram's law as agreement at lag 2

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_gram.py`, run to `t = 285` and exit 0, in a minute and a half on
the host. It computes the Riemann-Siegel theta function by truthy and falsy verdicts, places the Gram
points by it, and reads the sign of `Z` at each from the values entry 4 computes.

- The reading it is for. The sign of `Z(t)` at the Gram points is the reading the shift agreement
  detector and the null permutation identity are built for. Gram's law shows as agreement at lag 2.
  The null permutation needs 32 occurrences of each sign, about 64 Gram intervals, and both need the
  Riemann-Siegel theta function by truthy and falsy verdicts.
- The phase. `theta(t) = Im ln Gamma(1/4 + it/2) - (t/2) ln pi`, by Stirling's series after a shift
  of `M`, with `K` Bernoulli terms, every coefficient an exact rational. Two routes run, at
  `M = K = N` and at `2N`, and routes that disagree double `N`. Each arctangent is two series that
  must agree: Euler's, with pi from Euler's identity, and the Taylor series about `1/2`, with pi from
  Machin's. pi is held as its real and its operator, the floor at the places asked and
  `naturals.pi`, which is asked again for more.
- The Gram index. At a point it is `theta` over pi, decided where `theta` reads strictly between `i pi`
  and `(i + 1) pi`, each read toward zero at the same places. A reading of equal doubles the places.
  Up from `t = 10`, where `theta` increases, a cell holds as many Gram points as its ends' indices
  differ by. The walk finds 128 below `t = 285`, indices 0 to 127, each alone in its bracket, and
  places each by sixteen bits. It asks 5,198 values of `theta`, none deeper than eight places, none
  wider than `N = 4`.
- The sign of `Z`. `zeta(1/2 + it) = e^(-i theta) Z(t)`. Just below `g_n`, `Im zeta` has the sign of
  `Re zeta`, and just above it the opposite sign. This phase verdict ties `theta`, from Stirling, to
  the phase of `zeta`, from Euler-Maclaurin. A bracket is settled where the phase verdict holds at
  both ends, `Re zeta` has one nonzero sign at both, and entry 4's step verdict holds at both. Every
  sixteen-bit bracket settles on its first reading. The run asks 2,402 values of `zeta`, the widest at
  `N = 64`. The cut that a bracket not settled would take is written and has not run.
- Positive control, with an answer from outside. `g_0` to `g_15` against the table the Riemann-Siegel
  theta article on Wikipedia prints, read by a web fetch: each bracket holds its ten-place value,
  `17.8455995405` in `[17.8455810546, 17.8456420898]`. The same article reports Gram's law failing
  first at index 126. Here `(-1)^n Z(g_n)` is positive for `n` from 0 to 125, negative at 126, with
  `g_126` in `[282.4547119140, 282.4547424316]`, and positive at 127.
- Gram's law as agreement. The signs of `Z(g_n)` read as a sequence, 63 positive and 65 negative:
  agreement at lag 1 is 2 of 127, and at lag 2 is 125 of 126, by
  `measure.shift_agreement.exact_agreement`. Of 1,000 drawn orders of the same signs
  (`reference.shuffles.permuted`), none reaches 125 at lag 2, and the most any reaches is 80. The
  one failure costs one agreement at lag 2 and adds two at lag 1.
- Drawn null. With the Bernoulli terms left out of both routes, the gap between them at `t = 20` and
  eight places runs 27,385, 87,464, 210,132, 266,927, 155,769, 53,381 as `N` doubles from 1, and no
  index is decided. With them it runs 253, 1, 0.
- Failed hypothesis: Gram's law as a steer. The hypothesis is that the zero walk could step by Gram
  intervals, one zero in each, in place of its own halving. The zeros do not keep that pattern:
  `g_126` here has `(-1)^n Z(g_n)` negative, and the article reports Gram's law failing for about a
  quarter of Gram intervals in the long run. A walk steered to it is forced toward a pattern the
  zeros break and has to repair every interval that breaks it, which slows the walk it was meant to
  speed. That steer is not built and its cost is not measured here. The walk of entry 4 steers by
  its own verdicts, the halving that follows the zeros at every scale.
- What it is not. Gram's law is a pattern known to fail: the same article reports it failing, in the
  long run, for about a quarter of Gram intervals. It is a reading here and never a steer: the zero
  walk of entry 4 steers only by its own verdicts. Reading it to `t = 285` is a computation at a
  height and bears on nothing past it.

## Entry 6, 2026-10-02: the Riemann-Siegel formula, with time held as a real

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_riemann_siegel.py`, run to `t = 285` and exit 0. It computes
`Z(t)` by the Riemann-Siegel formula as the Riemann-Siegel Formula page on MathWorld prints it, read
by a web fetch: `Z(t) = 2 sum over n <= N of n^(-1/2) cos(theta(t) - t ln n) + R(t)`, with
`R(t) = (-1)^(N-1) (t / 2pi)^(-1/4) sum c_k(p) (t / 2pi)^(-k/2)` and `c_0` to `c_5` from the printed
table, each a sum of derivatives of `Psi(p) = cos 2pi(p^2 - p - 1/16) / cos 2pi p` over powers of pi.
The walk, the placing and the signs of entry 5 take seven seconds on the host this way.

Where the formula binds, and what is released in its place:

| where it is bound | as the formula states it | released here | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| time | `t` a decimal, `N = floor(sqrt(t / 2pi))`, `p = sqrt(t / 2pi) - N`, and powers of `t / 2pi` | the steer is `u`, with `t = 2pi u^4` held as its real and its operator: pi's floor at the places asked, and `naturals.pi` asked again for more. `N = floor(u^2)`, `p = u^2 - N` exactly, and `(t / 2pi)^(-1/4 - k/2) = u^-(2k+1)`, an exact rational. No square root is taken and nothing is divided by `2pi`. The delta `p` runs between 0 and 1 and is never fixed | built |
| `Psi` | a quotient, whose denominator vanishes at `p = 1/4` and `p = 3/4`, where the numerator vanishes too | the pair of the numerator and the denominator, each a power series about `p`, never divided. With `d` the denominator's first coefficient, `Psi^(j)(p) / j! = r_j / d^(j+1)`, `r_j` by products alone, and every `c_k` carried times `d^16 pi^10`, which is never negative. Where `d` reads zero at the working places, both series start one coefficient later | built. `u = 1.5` sits at `p = 1/4` exactly, and its gap against Euler-Maclaurin is 0, 0 and 5 units at 2, 4 and 8 places |
| the powers of pi | `1 / pi^(2m)` in each `c_k` | multiplied through by `pi^10` | built |
| the count of terms | `R` cut at a fixed `K`, with Gabcke's bounds on the error (his thesis, Satz 3.2.2, read for entry 7) | the last printed term, `c_5 u^-11`, read against `Z` at each point at the places `Z` is read: a reading, recorded per point, and no bound | the reading is built. Every `C_n` is built exactly by Gabcke's generator (entry 7). `R` here still stops at `c_5`: summed to the series' own least term, as a verdict, it is wanted, not built |
| the two sums | `M = N`, about `(t / 2pi)^(1/2)`, with `R(s)` an exact contour integral in the approximate functional equation | not released: `R` is taken as its asymptotic series | wanted, not built |

- The verdicts at a point. `theta` by entry 5's two routes. `Z d^16 pi^10` read toward zero at the
  places asked, and a reading of zero doubles the places. The work runs two guards deep and one is
  dropped.
- The walk. Entry 5's walk and placing, stepping in `u` from `1.2` with `theta` read at `2pi u^4`.
  It finds 128 Gram points below `t = 285`, indices 0 to 127, each alone in its bracket, and places
  each by sixteen bits in `u`, asking 5,108 values of `theta`. A bracket is settled where `Z` has one
  nonzero sign at both ends, and every bracket settles on its first reading: 470 values of `Z`, the
  deepest at 64 places, the main sum at most six terms.
- Positive control, with answers from outside. `g_0` to `g_15` from the table the Riemann-Siegel theta
  article on Wikipedia prints, each within `[2pi lo^4, 2pi hi^4]` by multiplication: `2 U^4` times
  pi's floor, and times the floor plus one, against the published value. `(-1)^n Z(g_n)` is positive
  for `n` from 0 to 125, negative at 126, with `g_126` in `u` in `[2.5893588321, 2.5893588792]`, and
  positive at 127, as the same article reports and as entry 5 reads by Euler-Maclaurin.
- `Z` against Euler-Maclaurin. `Re e^(i theta) zeta(1/2 + it)` by entry 4's two routes at the same
  real `t`, the gap in units of the last place at 2, 4 and 8 places:

  | `u` | `t` | with `R` | `R` left out |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1.2 | 13.02 | 0, 0, -281 | -33, -3,282, -32,823,842 |
  | 1.5 | 31.79 | 0, 0, 5 | 33, 3,371, 33,704,797 |
  | 1.8 | 65.92 | 0, 0, -1 | -29, -2,855, -28,550,818 |
  | 2.1 | 122.13 | 0, 0, 0 | 19, 1,897, 18,968,282 |
  | 2.4 | 208.35 | 0, 0, 0 | -21, -2,119, -21,190,339 |
  | 2.6 | 286.98 | 0, 0, 0 | 19, 1,957, 19,569,222 |

  The last term `c_5 u^-11` at 8 places reads -187, 71 and -10 units at `u` = 1.2, 1.5 and 1.8,
  and 0, 0 and -1 from `u = 2.1`: below `u = 2.1` the gap at 8 places is the series' own reach at
  that `t`. At every one of the 256 settled bracket ends, `Z` reads past `c_5 u^-11`.
- Drawn null. With `R` left out, the gap is 0.19 to 0.33 at every `u` shown, and the sign of
  `(-1)^n Z(g_n)` differs from the one with `R` at `n` = 33, 62, 70, 90, 105, 113 and 126.
- The cost. One value of `Z` takes 5 to 80 milliseconds on the host at 2 to 32 places. At
  `u = 2.1` and 8 places it takes 8 milliseconds against 2.6 seconds by Euler-Maclaurin, and at
  `u = 2.6`, 6 milliseconds against 18.4 seconds.
- What it is not. An asymptotic series read at the places it is read, below a height. Agreement
  with Euler-Maclaurin at eight places is two computations meeting, and the sign of `Z` at a Gram
  point is a reading there. It bears on nothing past `t = 285`.

## Entry 7, 2026-10-02: every C_n, where each vanishes, and the seam between the cells

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_riemann_siegel.py`, the same run as entry 6, exit 0. Three papers
were read for it, page by page, from copies here:
- Siegel, "Über Riemanns Nachlaß zur analytischen Zahlentheorie" (1932), in the Barkan and Sklar
  translation;
- Berry, "The Riemann-Siegel expansion for the zeta function: high orders and remainders", Proc. R. Soc.
  Lond. A 450 (1995), 439-462;
- Gabcke, "Neue Herleitung und explizite Restabschätzung der Riemann-Siegel-Formel", dissertation,
  Göttingen 1979, in the re-set copy whose footnotes and references run to 2011.

What they say that bears on this entry:

- Siegel replaces the saddle `xi = (s - 1) / (2 pi i m)` by `eta` because `m` must be an integer
  (p. 279), and that integer makes the terms depend on `t` discontinuously (p. 285).
- Gabcke, p. 54: where `t_M = 2pi M^2` and `N` steps from `M - 1` to `M`, `R_K(t)` is not continuous,
  and its jump is at most `2 c(K) t_M^(-(2K+3)/4)`.
- Gabcke, p. 55, Satz 3.2.2: for `t >= 200`, `|R_0| < 0.127 t^(-3/4)` up to `|R_9| < 1837 t^(-21/4)`,
  and the bounds are optimal for `K <= 4`. On p. 58, numerical study suggests `|R_10|` is
  overestimated by a factor of about `10^6`.
- Gabcke, foreword, p. v: whether `C_0` with `|R_0| < 0.127 t^(-3/4)` always decides the sign of `Z`
  "liegt aber wohl außerhalb der heutigen mathematischen Möglichkeiten". Footnote 3 there says the
  error can change sign inside a cell, and it is averaged over `[2pi N^2, 2pi (N + 1)^2]`.
- Gabcke, introduction, footnote 9: the main sum alone has two complex conjugate zeros near
  `t = 221.08`, where `Z` has two real zeros.
- Gabcke, pp. 58-59, section 3.3. Siegel writes (p. 285) that it is not trivial that `|R_K(t)|` does
  not go to zero as `K` grows with `t` fixed. Lower bounds `|C_2n(z)| >= w_2n` would prove it, and they
  fail: `C_2n` for `2n` = 4, 8 and 10 each has one simple zero in `0 < z < 1`, and only `|C_2n| >= 0`
  holds there. At `t = 2pi M^2` the series splits into two power series of radius 0, and the
  divergence holds at those `t`. Footnote 7 adds that a proof has since appeared, Berry 1995.
- Gabcke, p. 53: the bound of Satz 3.1.3 comes only from expanding `g(tau, z)` in powers of `tau`. In
  powers of `z` the coefficients would be polynomials in `tau`, with "fast unüberwindlichen
  Schwierigkeiten".
- Berry: `C_r` has its least term near `r* = 2pi t`, with a remainder of order `exp(-pi t)` across a
  Stokes line. His Appendix B gives `C_4l(1)` and `C_(4l+2)(1)` in closed form, from Gabcke's
  argument by continuity.

Every `C_n`, held as its real and its operator:

- **The generator.** With `z = 1 - 2p` and `F(z) = Psi(p)`, Gabcke's generator (his Table III) gives
  `C_n(z) = 2^(-2n) sum over k of d_k^(n) F^(3n-4k)(z) / ((3n - 4k)! pi^(2n-2k))`.
  - The `d` follow `d_k^(n+1) = (3n + 1 - 4k)(3n + 2 - 4k) d_k^(n) + d_(k-1)^(n)`, except
    `d_3l^(4l) = lambda_l`.
  - The `lambda` follow `(l + 1) lambda_(l+1) = sum 2^(4k+1) |E_(2k+2)| lambda_(l-k)` on the Euler
    numbers.
  - Every `d` is an integer.
- **F's coefficients.** `F` is entire and even. Its coefficient of `z^(2j)` comes from the product of the
  series of `cos(pi z^2 / 2 + 3pi/8)` and of `sec(pi z)`. It is a sum of rationals times
  `pi^(2j - m)`, times `sin(pi/8)` or `cos(pi/8)`, which are `sqrt(2 -+ sqrt 2) / 2`.
- **Held exactly.** Each `C_n` is held exactly, and only reading it at a point asks for digits.
- **A reading at a point.** It sums the Taylor series on `count` and `2 count` terms, the second at
  twice the extra digits, and the two must agree. The terms of the `sec` series grow as `4^j` and cancel
  to `F`'s: the extra digits grow with `count`.
- **Controls.**
  - `C_0` to `C_5` match MathWorld's `c_0` to `c_5` rational for rational.
  - `d_k^(8)` matches Gabcke's Table II, and `lambda_1` to `lambda_4` = 2, 82, 10,572 and 2,860,662,
    as his p. 77 prints them in primes.
  - `C_0(1)` to `C_10(1)` against the sum row of his Table IV at 50 places are apart by -2, 3, -3,
    -3, -1, 0, -2, 2, 1, 4 and -4 units of the 50th place. His Table IV and Table V sum rows, two
    routes to the same `C_n(1)`, differ by up to 5 units there, and that is the bar.
  - The controls, the zeros below, the fine sweep and the seam take 11.5 seconds on the host
    together.

Where each vanishes. The zeros of `C_n` on `0 < z < 1`:
- **How they are read.** They are the sign changes read on `2^m` and `2^(m+1)` parts, `m` from 6 and
  growing until the two counts agree, and each is halved to `2^-128`.
- **Odd `C_n`.** An odd `C_n` is zero at `z = 0` by parity, and its sign just past 0 is the sign of
  its `z` coefficient.
- **Where in a cell.** A zero `z` gives `p = (1 - z) / 2` and `(1 + z) / 2`. The term `C_n u^-(2n+1)`
  vanishes at `t = 2pi (N + p)^2` in every cell `N`.

- **Against Gabcke.** One simple zero each in `C_4`, `C_8` and `C_10`, as he reports on p. 59.
- **The other zeros.** `C_12` has two, and the zeros of `C_4`, `C_8`, `C_12`, `C_14`, `C_18` and
  `C_22` sit within `0.01` of `z = 1`, the integer `x` where the cells meet.
- **The fine sweep.** Two zeros between neighbors of the coarse grid would not show on it. On
  `[63/64, 1]` at `2^14` and `2^15` parts the counts agree for every `C_n` to `C_24`. They read one
  for `C_8`, `C_12`, `C_14`, `C_18` and `C_22`, and none for the rest.
- **What the table is.** A reading on the grids named, at the places read. It is not a count proven
  complete.

The seam:
- **What it is.** Where `x` crosses `nu + 1`, `S` gains a term and `R` changes cell (entry 6's
  header). The rest is the jump of the terms `R` leaves out, `-2 (-1)^nu` times the sum over even
  `k >= 6` of `C_k(1) u^-(2k+1)`.
- **Against the exact `C_k(1)`.** Read at 20 places against that sum for even `k` from 6 to 16, the
  ratio is 1.00000000 at `x` = 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8, and 0.99999999 at 5, 7 and 9. The seam is the left-out
  terms to eight places.
- **Fewer terms.** With `k` only to 12, through Berry's Appendix B, the ratio at `x = 2` read
  1.0000006.

The triangle between the two pairs (entry 6's header):
- **The sides.** Over each cell, `D = Z_RS - Z_EM` and `E = S - R` give three sides: `a = int |D|`,
  `b = int |E|` and `c = int |(D, E)| = b + delta`.
- **What it is read by.** The excess `kappa = (c^2 - a^2 - b^2) / a^2` and the angle
  `cos gamma = -kappa a / 2b`.
- **How it is run.** Euler-Maclaurin's `C` comes from the device (Z3), with `triangle first last`.
- **Where S and R cross.** There `E` is zero, and `delta`'s integrand is a spike of height `|D|` and
  width `|D / E'|`. In cell 4, the crossings read from `p = 0.686` to `0.990` sit about 0.03 apart.
  Each has `|D|` between `1.2 e-10` and `9.9 e-10`, `|E'|` between 80 and 240, and a width of about
  `10^-12` of `p`. A grid would need `2^36` to `2^40` parts to see one.
- **The growth.** The trapezoid on a spike grows by about `(D^2 / |E'|) ln 2` per crossing at every
  doubling of the parts. It stops only where the step reaches the spike's width, and that doubling is
  what made each cell take longer and longer.
- **The relation.** Each spike is held as its relation instead. With `D0 = D(p0)` and `k = |E'(p0)|`,
  it is `g(u) = D0^2 / (sqrt(D0^2 + k^2 u^2) + k |u|)`, `u = p - p0`. Its integral from 0 to `L` is
  `(L D0^2 / (sqrt(D0^2 + k^2 L^2) + kL) + (D0^2 / k) asinh(kL / |D0|)) / 2`, exactly. `delta` is the
  sum of those and the trapezoid of `f` less every `g`, which no longer grows.
- **Finding the crossings.** They are `E`'s sign changes, from Riemann-Siegel alone, each halved to
  `2^-64`.
- **Controls on the relation.** On a spike wide enough to resolve, `D0 = 10^-3`, `k = 2` and
  `L = 0.7`, the trapezoid's gap from the closed form falls by exactly 4 per doubling, from `2^16` to
  `2^19` parts. `ln` by the two artanh routes meets the logarithm of entry 4 at every digit.

| cell | `a` | `b` | `c - b` | `kappa` | `a / b` | `cos gamma` | parts | points | seconds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

- **The angle.** In every cell the triangle is a needle, `a` against `b`, and its angle is past right
  by an amount that reads nonzero at the places shown.
- **The device.** The device equals the host on every sweep.
- **The grid alone, overturned.** Before the relation, the trapezoid alone read cells 1 to 3 at
  `kappa` = 1.1, 10.8 and 2.3. The parts were `2^4`, `2^13` and `2^6`, taking 98, 1,020 and 268
  seconds. Those grids agreed at 2^m and 2^(m+1) parts while both missed every spike, and the
  readings are kept here with what overturned them.
- **A prediction, overturned.** From those readings, `kappa` was predicted high in cell 4 and low in
  cell 5. Held exactly, `kappa` reads 4.8, 18.7, 23.2, 20.8 and 18.1 across cells 1 to 5, and the
  prediction fails with the readings it came from.
- **The fault that stopped cells 4 and 5.** `d^16 pi^10` reads small near `p = 1/4`. The first change
  to `rs_at` counted the digits that multiplier lost and asked again until it lost none. That count is
  a property of `p` and not of the work, and it never reached zero. `rs_at` now sets the work once to
  the digits asked, the guard and the digits lost.
- **Cell 5's time.** It takes six times cell 4's, against 1.6 times the points. What grows there is
  not yet read.

What it is not. Each `C_n` is exact, and each zero is a bracket read at the places named, a reading
on a grid, never a count proven complete. The seam and the triangle are readings below `x = 9` and in
five cells. None of it bears on the zeros of `Z` or on the hypothesis.

## Entry 8, 2026-10-02: the triangle's dimension, and what each wave lands in at its boundary

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_riemann_siegel.py` for the dimension, and
`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_arrival.py` with its device program `exact_zeta_arrival.cu` for
the boundaries.

**The terms, as asked.** The triangle is a coordinate system, a dimension and time. Read here, without a
claim that it is the reading meant:
- the coordinates are the triangle's three sides;
- the dimension is each side's scaling exponent between neighboring cells,
  `ln(side_nu / side_(nu+1)) / ln(x_(nu+1) / x_nu)` with `x` at each cell's midpoint;
- the time is `t`, walked cell by cell.

**The dimension.** With `R` through MathWorld's `c_5`, the exponent of `a` reads 7.33, 6.54, 6.49 and
6.49 between cells 1 to 5. That is `x^-6.5 = u^-13`, the size of the first term `R` leaves out,
`c_6 u^-13`. The exponent of `b` reads 0.01, 0.09, 0.10, -0.13 and 0.20 between cells 1 to 6, from
`b`'s limit on `2^11` and `2^12` parts, each within `8 e-7` of the limit on `2^10` and `2^11`. The
exponent of `delta` reads 12.3, 12.4, 13.3 and 13.8.

`|E|` has a corner at each crossing of `S` and `R`, 25 of them in cell 4, and `|D|` one. The trapezoid
takes each corner by the line through its two points. With that, `a` and `b` settle as the grid halves, the
gap shrinking four times a halving. Without it, `b` over cell 4 reads 1.64704 on `2^8` parts and
1.64615 on `2^10`, a step of `9 e-4` from the grid alone, where the cut moves it `4 e-11`.

**The cut test.** If `a`'s dimension is the cut, then `R` through `C_K` moves it to `(2K + 3) / 2`. `R`
through `C_K` from the exact curves of entry 7 equals MathWorld's `R` at `K = 5` to 0 units at 30
digits, `S` too, at five points that include `p = 1/4`. Through `C_6`, the exponent of `a` reads 8.22,
7.90, 7.75 and 7.67 between cells 2 to 6, against 7.5. Through `C_8` it reads 10.62, 10.13, 9.91 and
9.79, against 9.5. Through `C_10` it reads 13.11, 12.46, 12.13 and 11.95, against 11.5. All three come down onto the cut from above and none goes below it in these cells.

**The omitted curves.** `a` is predicted from the exact curves alone, with no Euler-Maclaurin and no
device: `|sum C_k(1 - 2p) x^(-k - 1/2)|` over the cell for `k` from `K + 1` to `K + 3`, the terms `R`
leaves out (`omitted first last K`). It needs no grid. With `z = 1 - 2p` and `X = nu + 1/2`, each
weight is `x^(-k - 1/2) = X^(-1/2) (2 / (2 nu + 1))^k (1 - z / (2X))^(-k - 1/2)`, a series in `z`
with rational coefficients. The integrand is then one power series in `z` times `X^(-1/2)`. Its zeros
are halved to `2^-(4 (digits + GUARD))`, and between them the integral is the antiderivative's
difference, term by term. The series at `n` and `2n` terms agree at 24 places, and the run at 60
places agrees with it at all 24. The trapezoid on the same integrand closes on it four times a
halving, `2.8 e-6`, `7.0 e-7` and `1.7 e-7` on `2^9` to `2^11` parts over cell 4 through `C_6`.
Each cell takes a quarter of a second where the triangle takes hours. Between cells, the exponent
it gives against the one measured:

| `R` through | exponent from the omitted curves | measured |
|---|---|---|
| `C_5`, five curves | 7.265, 6.536, 6.493, 6.490 | 7.33, 6.54, 6.493, 6.489 |
| `C_6` | 8.218, 7.895, 7.750, 7.673 | 8.222, 7.896, 7.751, 7.673 |
| `C_8` | 10.607, 10.133, 9.909, 9.786 | 10.617, 10.134, 9.910, 9.786 |
| `C_10` | 13.089, 12.451, 12.132, 11.950 | 13.106, 12.455, 12.134, 11.951 |

Past the measured cells it gives, between cells 5 to 9, 6.491, 6.494, 6.496 and 6.497 through
`C_5`; and between cells 6 to 9, 7.627, 7.597 and 7.576 through `C_6`, 9.711, 9.662 and 9.628
through `C_8`, and 11.836, 11.760 and 11.707 through `C_10`. Only between cells 1 and 2 do the
curves fall short, by 0.07, where `x` is 2 and the series is at its weakest.

Through `C_6`, `C_8` and `C_10` the omitted curves have one zero in every cell from 1 to 9. Through
`C_5` they have one in cells 1 to 5 and none from cell 6 on. `C_6`, the curve leading them, has
none of its own.

**Hypotheses, with what tests them.**
- Where the curve grazes its boundary, its dimension rises. The excess over `(2K + 3) / 2` is
  0.72, 0.40, 0.25 and 0.17 between cells 2 to 6 through `C_6`, and 1.12, 0.63, 0.41 and 0.29 through
  `C_8`, larger at every cell, and 1.61, 0.96, 0.63 and 0.45 through `C_10`. The omitted curves give each
  of them: the shape of `|C_(K+1)|` with its next two curves, weighted by `x^(-k - 1/2)` across a cell
  of width 1.
- The exponent acts as a spring: pushed off its value, it returns, cyclically. Through `C_5` the exponent goes below 6.5 at cell 3 and comes back
  toward it from below across cells 5 to 9, as the omitted curves give it. It does not go back above
  6.5 in those cells. Through `C_6`, `C_8` and `C_10` it stays above the cut.
- At `C_8`, the pressure that escaped the other dimension lowers its potential toward the field
  mean. From `C_6` to `C_8` on the same grid, `b` falls with `a` in every
  cell, by 0.68, 0.54, 0.29, 0.28 and 0.18 of `a`'s fall over cells 2 to 6.
- Placing the triangle in π's circle and tracing its origin points gives its angular momentum. Each
  triangle's angle opposite `c` is a right angle less than `1 e-7` off, which puts `c` on the
  diameter of its circle. By the law of cosines the amount off is `kappa / 4` times `2a / c`, the
  angle `a` takes from the center: what the circle holds is `kappa`, which the three sides already give.

**The ball.** "the ball sticks to the triangle, and the triangle plane is spatially unconstrained so
it can be upside down, we are looking at an object on a plane in a sphere"; "that gives smooth
natural movement for the complex integral that is the curve, for all degrees of freedom n". Read with
`sphere first last K m`, over cells 2 to 6 through `C_10` on `2^8` parts:
- **The sphere.** Each wave `z_n = e^(i theta) n^-s` is one complex coordinate of radius `n^(-1/2)`,
  and the point `(z_1, ..., z_nu)` keeps `|z|^2 = H_nu`, the harmonic number. It holds within 68
  units of `10^-44` at every point.
- **The turning.** Wave `n` turns at `theta'(t) - ln n`, with mass `1 / n`. `theta'` is
  `Re psi(1/4 + it/2) / 2 - ln(pi) / 2`, `psi` by Stirling's series in two routes that agree, and it
  meets `theta`'s central difference to 28 places at `t` = 25, 100 and 1000.
- **The boundaries.** Wave `n` joins at `t = 2pi n^2` turning at `-1 / (48 t^2)` to its first
  term: `-3.299 e-5`, `-6.515 e-6`, `-2.061 e-6`, `-8.443 e-7` and `-4.072 e-7` for `n` = 2 to 6. The
  angular momentum `L = sum (theta' - ln n) / n` steps there by that over `n`, `2.2 e-6` at `n = 3`,
  and the energy `sum (theta' - ln n)^2 / 2n` by its square over `2n`, `7 e-12`.
- **The shadows.** `Z = 2 Re W + R`, with `W` the sum of the waves. `Z` changes sign 9, 17, 27, 38 and
  49 times in cells 2 to 6, the same on `2^9` parts. With the three zeros below `8 pi` that is 143 to
  `t = 98 pi`, as the zero count `N(T)` gives at 307.9. `E` changes sign 8, 13, 25, 28 and 49 times,
  the triangle's crossings, and `D` once a cell.
- **The sideways shadow.** `D x^11.5` is one curve across the cells, changing sign with each and of
  size 6.78, 6.52, 6.43, 6.39, 6.37 and 6.35 `e-7` at `x` = 2 to 7, the same on either side of each
  boundary to three figures.

**The boundaries.** The main sum is the waves `m^(-1/2) e^(i(theta - t ln m))`.
- **Where each wave joins.** In the frame `e^(i theta)` turns, wave `m` spins at `ln(x / m)`, still at
  `x = m`, where it joins the sum, at `t = 2pi n^2` for `n = m`.
- **Its angle there.** The arriving wave's phase there is `-pi n^2 - pi / 8` to `theta`'s first terms:
  `-pi / 8` for even `n` and `pi - pi / 8` for odd. Read at every boundary to `n = 1600`, it matches
  that to a sine of `8.3 e-4` at most, at the smallest `n`.
- **What it lands in.** The waves already there stand at `2pi n^2 ln m` modulo a turn, and the
  logarithms of the primes are linearly independent over the rationals.
- **The reading.** At each boundary, the angle between the arriving wave and the sum of the waves
  already there.

**The relation, on the device.** Along `n`, wave `m`'s phase `n^2 ln m` has the constant second
difference `2 ln m`.
- **One lane a wave.** Each lane steps from one boundary to the next by `u <- u r` and `r <- r q`, at
  the scale `2^62`.
- **The seeds.** At a window's first boundary every seed is completely multiplicative in `m`. Only
  the primes ask for a cosine and a sine, and each composite is a product over its least prime factor.
- **The sum.** Each boundary is summed across its lanes by `cycle_record_sum`, the exact sum across
  lanes built for this. It accumulates every limb into its own column, and merges and rounds nothing.
- **The mean.** Each boundary's unit reading goes into a tally, and the mean at every boundary is
  tally over run, an exact rational.
- **The spread.** It is read as `|tally|^2 / (run S^2)`: `run` where every reading points one way,
  near 1 for independent angles.

**Controls.**
- **The control window.** In a window from `n0 = 0`, the device's sum at every 17th boundary meets
  the direct exact sum on the host within 16,654 units of `2^-62`, inside the drawn bar of `2^-40`.
- **Each window's own check.** At the first and last boundary of each window, the device's sum
  meets the direct exact sum on the host within the bar. The gaps, in units of `2^-62`, are 491 and
  772,737 at 1000; 4,988 and 1,483,898 at 10,000; 49,994 and 1,101,445 at 100,000; and 498,988 and
  734,973 at 1,000,000. The last boundary carries a window's stepped floors, about `3 e-13` at most.
- **The port check.** The host's records of every window's first sweep equal the device's word for
  word.
- **The spread, by a second route.** Over the window at 1000, the spread at runs 16, 64, 256 and
  1024 reads 4.2482, 2.9868, 0.5102 and 0.1521. The angles read from direct host sums in floating
  point give 4.2482, 2.9868, 0.5102 and 0.1522.

| window | waves | spread at run 16 | 64 | 256 | 1024 | device seconds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1000 to 2023 | 2,024 | 4.2482 | 2.9868 | 0.5102 | 0.1521 | 1.0 |
| 10000 to 11023 | 11,024 | 0.8661 | 0.1571 | 0.4037 | 1.2314 | 1.5 |
| 100000 to 101023 | 101,024 | 0.3049 | 3.1449 | 0.6269 | 0.4733 | 4.4 |
| 1000000 to 1001023 | 1,001,024 | 3.6411 | 4.5746 | 0.9102 | 0.0953 | 31.9 |

**What the table shows.**
- **Spread around the circle.** The readings go all the way around, and by run 1024 no window holds
  one direction.
- **The spread at run 1024.** Three windows read below 1, more even than independent angles, and one
  above. Four windows do not make a trend.

**What it is not.** These are readings of angles at boundaries, in four windows, at the places read.
Whether the angles are equidistributed, and how evenly, is a question about all `n`, and none of it
bears on the zeros of `Z` or on the hypothesis.

## Entry 9, 2026-10-03: Turing's method, run as a machine over the record machine's automata

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_turing.py`, the machine, with its device programs in
`exact_zeta_turing.cu`, built by `exact_zeta_turing.sh`.

**The claim.** Every zero of zeta with ordinate in `(760.265422, 565486.677646]` lies on the critical line
and is simple: 936,221 of them. `N(760.265422) = 460` and `N(565486.677646) = 936,681`, each held to one
value.

**The three bounds it stands on.**
- `|integral of S from t_1 to t_2| <= 2.067 + 0.059 log t_2` for `t_2 > t_1 > 168 pi` (Trudgian,
  Improvements to Turing's method, Math. Comp. 80 (2011), Theorem 2.2).
- `Z = 2 sum over m <= nu of m^(-1/2) cos(theta - t ln m) + (-1)^(nu - 1) x^(-1/2) C_0 + E` with
  `|E| <= 0.127 t^(-3/4)` for `t >= 200`: Gabcke's bound, as Hiary, Patel and Yang state it (An improved
  explicit estimate for zeta(1/2 + it), Lemma 2.1).
- `theta(t) = (t/2) log(t / (2 pi e)) - pi/8 + 1/(48 t) + E_theta` with
  `|E_theta| <= (7/5760 + pi/960) t^(-3) + exp(-pi t) / 2` (Brent, On asymptotic approximations to the
  log-Gamma and Riemann-Siegel theta functions, Theorems 5 and 6).

**The lattice.** Point `j` of cell `nu` stands at `t = 2 pi s`, `s = x^2 = nu^2 + j (2 nu + 1) / P`,
`j < P = 2^p`: even in `t`, and in `theta` to within `1 / nu` across the cell. `P` is the least power
of 2 that gives the cell 4 points or more for each unit `theta / pi` rises across it, each zero's
share: `2^9` points at cell 10, `2^14` at cell 127, `2^15` at cell 300.

**The automata.** Programs of the record machine, each checked against the host's run of the
same program word for word. A lane works out its own values from `nu`, `p` and constants that do not
depend on the cell. No table is read, and no value is filled in a lane at a time by the host.
- **The logarithm folds.** `ln(V / 2^b) = f ln 2 + 2 artanh((V - 2^(b + f)) / (V + 2^(b + f)))`, where
  `2^f` is the product of `1 + [V > 2^(b + i)]` over `i`. The artanh's argument lies in `[0, 1/3]`,
  and 21 terms of its series carry it to `2^-62`.
- **The roots by Newton's rule.** `w^(-1/2)` by `y (3 - w y^2) / 2` from `2^(-g - 1)`, where `2^g` is
  the product of `1 + [w > 4^i]` over `i`. It starts within a factor 2 of the root and below it, and
  8 steps carry it to `2^-62`.
- **The pole stage.** One lane a `k <= nu`: `ln k` and `k^(-1/2)`, once each.
- **The point stage.** One lane a point: `theta / pi = s ln s - s - 1/8 + 1 / (96 pi^2 s)`,
  `x = s s^(-1/2)`, `C_0(z)` at `z = 1 - 2 (x - nu)` by Horner's rule over its Taylor coefficients,
  `x^(-1/2)`, and their product with the sign `(-1)^(nu - 1)`.
- **The pair stage.** One lane a pair `(point, k)`, which reads its pole's record and its point's
  record through the index, at the scale `2^62`:
  - the phase over pi, `Q = theta / pi - 2 s ln k`;
  - `Q` taken modulo 2 by a wrap, and `cos(pi s)` by Horner's rule in `s^2`;
  - the term `k^(-1/2) cos(pi s)`, 168 steps.

  The terms of a point are consecutive lanes, and `cycle_record_sum` adds each run of `nu` of them.
- **The verdict stage.** One lane a point, over the sums, the point records and a shared record as
  its three members: `Z = 2 sum + R`, its sign where `|Z|` clears the bound and 0 where it does not,
  the bracket of `theta / pi`, and its two ends times the step of `s`, `2 nu + 1` over `P`, the same at
  every point and from a cell's last point to the next cell's point 0.
- **The count stage.** One lane a point `q`, over the verdict records at `q`, `q - 1` and `q - 2` as
  its three members: a zero ends at `q` where the last certified sign before it, one or two points
  back, is the other, with `x^2` at both of its ends.

Over the cell's first certified point `F`, `cycle_record_sum` adds the stepped brackets and the zeros
and their ends on each side of `F`, and the cell returns those sums with `F`, its last certified
point and its point 0. The machine joins a cell's sums to its neighbors'.

Every constant comes from the house's exact series at `2^126` and is floored to `2^62`. Every
division is toward zero, by one limb. The machine bounds the device's error step by step and adds it to
the two analytic bounds, and the device certifies a point's sign where `|Z|` clears the sum.

**The main sum by the multiple evaluation.** In place of the pair stage, the device takes the main sum
at every point of a cell at once, by the multiple evaluation of Odlyzko and Schonhage.
- **The transform.** With `a_k = k^(-1/2) exp(-2 pi i nu^2 ln k)` and `pos_k = (2 nu + 1) ln k`, the
  sum's half at point `j` is `Re(exp(i theta) F_j)`, `F_j = sum over k of a_k exp(-2 pi i j pos_k / P)`.
  `F` is the discrete Fourier transform of `u_h / P = sum over k of q_k / (z_h - w_k)`, a sum of `nu`
  poles `w_k = exp(2 pi i pos_k / P)` at the `P` roots of unity `z_h`, each with charge
  `q_k = -a_k (1 - exp(-2 pi i pos_k)) w_k / P`.
- **The tree.** Leaves of 16 frequencies, halving up to 8 boxes. Each box holding poles takes their
  multipole of order 28, carries it to its parent, and across to every box of its interaction list,
  those three to five boxes away. Each box's local expansion carries down to its children. A point
  reads its leaf's local expansion by Horner's rule and its five nearest leaves' poles whole, through
  the Dirichlet kernel. Then `p` stages of Stockham's transform give `F`.
- **The arithmetic.** Each shift's binomial sum is an exact integer sum, and its one division leaves
  the error where it was. Each program holds at most one array live, in two limbs a value, inside the
  register file's 256 limbs. Each stage is one program, run once a level, and every program is the
  same for every cell at a given `P`, `nu` a field of its record.
- **The bound.** `transform_error` bounds the expansions' truncation at each level by
  `c^28 / ((1 - c) |D|)`, `c = 2 rho / |D| <= 0.43`. It bounds their arithmetic in a weighted norm the
  shifts do not grow past `4/3` a level. Both are summed over every point the transform reads.

Its lanes grow with `P` and not with `nu P`. It agrees with the pair stage to `1.3 e-15` at every point
of cells 10 to 12. Over cells 10 to 127 it certifies the same 139,676 zeros and holds the same
`N(101341.495819) = 140,136`, with every port check equal, in 469 seconds against the pairs' 213: below
cell 300 a cell's fixed cost, about two seconds to read its programs and run its levels, outweighs the
lanes it saves. With every program kept, one cell takes 2.5 seconds by either method at cell 298, 3.8
against 4.4 by pairs at cell 1,000, and 5.6 against 12.6 at cell 3,000.

**The count on a lattice.** Turing's argument needs only certified signs and brackets of
`theta / pi` at lattice points, with no Gram points:
- **The zeros.** Two certified points of opposite sign hold a zero between them.
- **On each step.** `theta` lies between its values at the step's two ends, since it increases. The
  certified zeros past `T` are at most `N(t) - N(T)`.
- **The two bounds on N.**
  - Integrated over one cell after `T`, Trudgian's bound gives `N(T) <= 1 + B / (2 pi D) + sum of d_i (Theta_(i+1) - c_i) / D`.
  - Over one cell before `T`, it gives `N(T) >= 1 + sum of d_i (k_(i+1) + Theta_i) / D - B / (2 pi D)`.
  - Every sum is exact.

**The machine.** It runs the automata cell by cell, from `nu = 10`, where `t` passes `168 pi`, to
`nu = 300`. Then, round by round:
1. It holds `N` at every cell's first certified point.
2. It runs again, four times finer, each cell whose certified zeros fall short of the difference of
   `N` at its ends, and the cells about a point where `N` is not held to one value.
3. It counts again.

| round | lattice | zeros certified | cells short | points where `N` is not one value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 points or more a zero | 933,683 | 252 | 237 |
| 1 | four times finer in those cells and their neighbors | 936,175 | 34 | 19 |
| 2 | four times finer again in those | 936,221 | 0 | 0 |

The run takes 939 seconds. Over cells 10 to 127 the same machine certifies 139,676 zeros in
`(760.265422, 101341.495819]` and holds `N(101341.495819) = 140,136`, in 213 seconds.

**Controls.**
- **The house's Z.** At `s = 10^2` and `s = 10^2 + 170 (21) / 2^9`, the device's `Z` meets the
  house's main sum and remainder through `C_0` within `1.5 e-11`, the house reading `x` to 40
  places. That gap is the `7 / (5760 t^3)` of `theta` that the device omits and the bound carries.
- **The port check.** The host's records equal the device's word for word, and its sums equal the
  device's, at every run.
- **Odlyzko's table of the first 100,000 zeros.**
  - Zero 460 is 758.900 and zero 461 is 760.282: `N(760.265422) = 460`.
  - On cells 10 to 30 the machine certifies 4,763 zeros in `(760.265422, 5654.866776]` and holds
    `N(5654.866776) = 5,223`. The table has 4,763 in that span, and its zero 5,223 is 5654.192.
  - `N(565486.677646)` lies past the table's last zero.
- **The bound on Z.** It runs from `1.0 e-3` at cell 10 to `2.2 e-5` at cell 127 and `6.2 e-6` at
  cell 300. Gabcke's term is most of it at every cell. The device's arithmetic adds `2.2 e-13` to it
  at cell 10, `3.7 e-10` at cell 127 and `4.9 e-9` at cell 300. By the multiple evaluation, its
  truncation and arithmetic add `1.6 e-9` at cell 10, `5.9 e-9` at cell 127 and `1.8 e-8` at cell 298.

**What it is not.** A verification of the hypothesis on `(760.265422, 565486.677646]`, by Turing's
method and the three published bounds above. Below 760.265422 it says nothing, and the published
verifications reach far past `10^5`. The computation is exact. Its rigor is that of the bounds it
cites, and of the step-by-step bound on the device's arithmetic in `arithmetic`.

## Entry 10, 2026-10-03: Harish-Chandra's spherical function, on the plane the modular surface is a quotient of

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_spherical.py`, with its device program in
`exact_zeta_spherical.cu`, built by `exact_zeta_spherical.sh`.

**The function.** `SL(2, R)` acts on the upper half plane `H` by Mobius maps, `SO(2)` fixes `i`, and
`H = SL(2, R) / SO(2)`. Harish-Chandra's spherical function `phi_r` is the function on `H` radial about
`i`, 1 there, and an eigenfunction of the Laplacian with eigenvalue `-(1/4 + r^2)`. At hyperbolic
distance `d` from `i`, with `u = sinh^2(d / 2)`, `phi_r = 2F1(1/2 + i r, 1/2 - i r; 1; -u)`.

**Its place on the modular surface.** The modular surface is `SL(2, Z)\H`.
- **The Selberg transform.** A kernel `k(u)` of the distance alone acts on every eigenfunction of the
  Laplacian with eigenvalue `-(1/4 + r^2)` as multiplication by `h(r)`, the integral of `k` against
  `phi_r`. The trace formula on the surface reads every such kernel through its `h`.
- **The c-function.** For large `d`, `phi_r` is `c(r) e^((i r - 1/2) d) + c(-r) e^((-i r - 1/2) d)`,
  with `c(r) = Gamma(i r) / (sqrt(pi) Gamma(1/2 + i r))` and `|c(r)|^(-2) = pi r tanh(pi r)`.
- **The scattering.** The surface has one cusp. Its Eisenstein series' constant term carries
  `phi(1/2 + i r) = pi c(r) zeta(2 i r) / zeta(1 + 2 i r)`, Gindikin and Karpelevich's product of
  `c` with zeta. Continued to `Re(s) < 1/2`, `phi(s)` has a pole at `s = rho / 2` for every
  non-trivial zero `rho` of zeta.

**The two routes.** One lane a point `(r, u)` of the grid, in one program of the record machine.
- **Route one.** The series in `-u`. Term `n + 1` is term `n` times `-u ((n + 1/2)^2 + r^2) / (n + 1)^2`,
  real and alternating for `u < 1`.
- **Route two.** Pfaff's transformation,
  `phi_r = (1 + u)^(-1/2) exp(-i r ln(1 + u)) 2F1(1/2 + i r, 1/2 + i r; 1; z)`, `z = u / (1 + u)`, a
  complex series whose term `n + 1` is term `n` times `z (n + 1/2 + i r)^2 / (n + 1)^2`.
  `ln(1 + u)` is `2 artanh(u / (2 + u))` by Horner's rule, `(1 + u)^(-1/2)` is Newton's rule from
  `4/5`, and `exp(i pi s)` is `cos(pi s)` by Horner's rule in `s^2` and `sin(pi s)` as
  `cos(pi (s - 1/2))`.

Route two's real part is route one, and its imaginary part is 0. Every value is an integer at `2^62`,
and every product taken back to it divides by `2^31` twice, toward zero.

**The bounds.** Each term's ratio rises with `u` and with `r`, and the grid's far corner bounds every
lane. The term count of each route is the least whose tail at that corner is below `2^-64`, and
`bounds` carries the device's error on a term from term to term by its ratio, adding the units each
step's divisions take.

**The run.** `r` in `[0, 8)` by `1/8` and `u` in `[0, 1/2)` by `1/128`: 4,096 lanes, one program of
4,924 steps, route one 90 terms and route two 58.
- **The bounds.** Route one within `1.147 e-15`, route two within `2.193 e-11`. Route one's partial
  sums stay below `2.966 e4`.
- **The routes.** They differ by `6.288 e-18` at most, and route two's imaginary part is `5.638 e-18`
  at most.
- **The origin.** `phi_r = 1` at `u = 0` for every `r`, exactly.
- **The exact series.** At four points, among them the grid's corners, the device meets route one's
  exact rational sum to within `7 e-19`: at `r = 0, u = 63/128` it reads `0.902522889373350`, and at
  `r = 63/8, u = 63/128` it reads `-0.216554272426581`.
- **The port check.** The host's records equal the device's word for word.

**What it is not.** The spherical function at the points of a grid, by two routes and their bounds.
It computes no Selberg transform, no Eisenstein series and no scattering, and it says nothing about
the hypothesis.

## Entry 11: a counted zero turned into a certificate a second reader checks in one pass

`examples/0_experimental/zeta_zero_certificate.py`.

**The two costs.** `exact_zeta_zeros.py` counts a zero by walking a path around a box and summing the
eighth turns of zeta, splitting an edge wherever a chord or a step verdict is not yet positive. That
walk is a search: it decides for itself how deep to read each point and how far to subdivide, and it
is the expensive half. Checking its answer is the cheap half, and the two are separated here.

**The certificate.** The settled path and, for each of its points, the places and the `N` at which the
two routes of `exact_zeta_zeros.py` agreed. It records where to read and how deep, never what was
found. The checker re-reads each point once at that depth, re-derives the eighth of a turn from the
exact value, and confirms three things: the two routes agree, the turns close to a whole number of
circles, and every chord and step verdict is positive. No point is read twice and nothing is
subdivided; the count falls out of the turns.

**Why the check is a proof.** This is the division Proth's theorem draws for a prime
`N = k 2^n + 1`: a witness `a` is hard to find and proves nothing until `a^((N - 1) / 2) = -1` settles
it in one exponentiation. The eighth turns are the eighth roots of unity, and the turn from point to
point is subtraction in that group, the group the twiddle table of a number theoretic transform lives
in. The sum of the turns is the winding, and on a box symmetric about `Re(s) = 1/2` a winding of one
circle holds a zero on the line, because the symmetry `s -> 1 - conj(s)` brings an off-line zero's
mirror into the same box (entry 3).

**The group law is not enough.** The winding alone is the twiddle table's trap in another dress: a
root of half the required order satisfies every relation among the table entries, and only the order
test catches it. A path too coarse to resolve the turning can sum to a whole circle by luck while no
chord is proved. The chord and step verdicts are that order test: a chord holds the angle across an
edge under a sixth of a turn, a step holds the motion under the size, and together they lift the sum
from the group of eighths to the integers. Prove the steps, then trust the count; the reverse is a
fast wrong answer.

**Controls.** The unit tiles from `t = 14` to `t = 26` meet edge to edge, three certified to hold one
zero each against Odlyzko's published table and the rest to hold none, a tile holding two zeros halved
until each half holds one. An understated depth is refused. Drawn null: the four corners alone, whose
winding is already one circle and whose chords the checker refuses, the twiddle table's half-order
floor in the plane. It claims nothing about the hypothesis.

## Entry 12: the phase of zeta read finer than its reader

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_phase.py`.

**The reader.** `exact_zeta_zeros.py` reads zeta at a point through three sign verdicts: the sign of
the real part, the sign of the imaginary part, and the sign of `|Re| - |Im|`. Together they name the
eighth of a turn zeta sits in. The reader never forms an angle and never divides.

**The jitter.** Rotate the value by `j / J` of an eighth turn for `j = 0 .. J - 1` and read each
rotation with the same three verdicts. With the phase `u` counted in eighths, reading `j` is
`floor(u + j / J)`, and Hermite's identity sums them exactly, `sum over j < J of floor(u + j / J) =
floor(J u)`. The mean of `J` coarse readings is the phase to `1 / J` of an eighth, an equality and not
an estimate; each jitter adds its verdict and none is discarded. The jitter has to be evenly spaced
across one whole eighth: the same offset read `J` times returns the coarse reading `J` times, and
offsets spread across half an eighth bias the mean toward the step they never reach.

**The turn between jitters.** Euler's `e^(i a)` turns the value one way at a known rate, and across all
`J` jitters it turns less than an eighth. The lifted reading is therefore 0 up to one crossing and 1
after it, and two jitters that read alike read alike at every jitter between them. The crossing is
found by bisection in `log2 J + 1` readings in place of `J`, and both routes run in the control and
must agree.

**The depth.** The value is read at a count of places by the two routes, `N` doubling until they
agree. The jittered index is read at those places and again at twice them, and the places double until
the two indices agree. The reader cannot draw more out of a value than the value holds, and the depth
each point needs is decided by that agreement, not assigned in advance.

**The line.** On `Re(s) = 1/2`, zeta is `e^(-i theta) Z` with `Z` real, and the phase of zeta is
`-theta` up to a half turn. `theta` comes by a second route, Stirling's series in `exact_zeta_gram.py`,
which shares nothing with the sign reader. Where `Z` changes sign the phase jumps a half turn, and each
published zero falls inside a step where the jittered phase jumps.

**Controls.** `e^(i pi / 3)`, whose phase is `4/3` of an eighth, read as `floor(4 J / 3) / J` for every
`J`; and the line against `-theta` at `J = 1024`. Drawn nulls: the repeated offset and the half spread,
each blind to the third of an eighth above the step. It claims nothing about the hypothesis.

## Entry 13: the Riemann-Siegel curves and the phase's logarithm, on the device

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_lobes.py`, with its two device stages in `exact_zeta_lobes.cu`,
built by `exact_zeta_lobes.sh`. These are the device realizations of the wants Z1 and Z9 name, run over
one cell and fed to the Riemann-Siegel remainder (entry 6) and the Turing machine (entry 9).

**The cell.** Lane `l` stands at `x = nu + l / 2^b` over `2^b + 1` points, with `X = nu 2^b + l` and
`z = 1 - 2 p = Zt / 2^b`, `Zt = 2^b - 2 l`, and the sign `s = (-1)^(nu - 1)`. Every value is a mantissa
in a register and a binary exponent the program holds: a product multiplies the mantissas and adds the
exponents, a power of two is where a mantissa is laid in the record, and nothing is divided.

**The curve stage.** `C_n(z)` is the sum over `j` of `g_(n,j) z^j`, each `g` a Gabcke coefficient held
at the binary scale `2^-256`, read by Horner's rule as `H_n = sum over j of g_(n,j) Zt^j 2^(b (J_n - 1 - j))`.
Curve `n`'s part of `R x^(1/2)` is `s C_n(z) x^(-n)`, and over the common denominator `X^K` it is the
integer `T_n = s H_n 2^(b n) X^(K - n)`, each output at its own binary exponent.

**The log stage.** `A = ln(X / (nu 2^b)) = 2 artanh(l / D)`, `D = 2 nu 2^b + l`, one series a lane.
With `c_k = Lambda / (2k + 1)`, `Lambda` the least common multiple of the odd numbers below `2L`, the
first `L` terms sum to `2 l S / (Lambda D^(2L - 1))`, `S = sum over k < L of c_k l^(2k) D^(2(L - 1 - k))`.
The stage outputs `l S`, `D^(2L - 1)`, `l^(2L + 1)` and `D^2 - l^2`: `A` lies at or above the partial
sum and below it plus the tail `2 l^(2L + 1) / ((2L + 1) D^(2L - 1) (D^2 - l^2))`.

**The run.** `nu = 2`, `b = 9`, 513 points; the curves `C_0` through `C_3` at `2^-256`; the logarithm
by 48 terms.
- **The host.** Its records equal the device's word for word.
- **The curves.** Each `C_n` read back from the device meets `c_at`'s exact rational to `9.2 e-38`
  across the cell, the residual the 160-term truncation where `z` reaches the cell's ends.
- **The logarithm.** Every bracket holds the exact `2 artanh(l / D)`, the widest `3.4 e-70` wide.

**What it is not.** Two device stages over one cell. It computes no `Z` and certifies no zero, and it
claims nothing about the hypothesis.

## Entry 14: the zeros below 760.265422, by Euler-Maclaurin on the device

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_turing.py` with `em`, the fourth method of entry 9's machine, its
stage in `exact_zeta_turing.cu`.

**The claim.** Every zero of zeta with ordinate in `(0, 760.265422]` lies on the critical line and is
simple: 460 of them. With entry 9, every zero in `(0, 565486.677646]`, 936,681 of them.

**What below 760.265422 needs.** Gabcke's bound holds for `t >= 200` and Trudgian's for `t > 168 pi`,
and neither reaches down. Turing's count is not needed there: entry 9's machine holds
`N(760.265422) = 460` over cells 10 to 12, and 460 certified sign changes in `(2 pi, 760.265422]` are
every zero below it, none left for `(0, 2 pi]`. The count needs only a bound on `Z` that holds down
to `t = 2 pi`.

**The bound.** `zeta(s) = sum over n < N of n^(-s) + N^(-s) C`, with
`C = N / (s - 1) + 1/2 + sum over k <= M of B_2k / (2k)! (s)_(2k-1) N^(1 - 2k)`, and the remainder is
at most `4 |(s)_2M| / ((2 pi)^(2M) (sigma + 2M - 1) N^(sigma + 2M - 1))` for `N >= 2` and
`sigma + 2M > 1`, at every `t` (Johansson, arXiv:1309.2877, Theorem 1, at `a = 1` with no
derivative). On the line, `Z = sum over n < N of n^(-1/2) cos(theta - t ln n) + Re(exp(i theta) N^(-s) C)`.
A cell takes the least `N` with `|s + j| / (2 pi N) <= 1/2` for every `j < 2M` across it, and the
remainder is then below `4 N^(1/2) 2^(-2M) / (2M - 1/2)`. `theta` is Brent's, as in entry 9, which
holds for every `t > 0`.

**The stage.** The pole stage gives `ln n` and `n^(-1/2)` for `n <= N`, and the pair stage takes the
`N - 1` terms of the head as a point's terms. The Euler-Maclaurin stage is one lane a point, over the
pole `N`'s record, the point's record and a shared record:
- the phase over pi, `Q = theta / pi - 2 s ln N`, and its cosine and sine;
- `1 / (s - 1)` by a complex reciprocal;
- `tau_1 = s / (12 N)` and `tau_k = tau_(k-1) r_k (s + 2k - 3)(s + 2k - 2) / N^2`, each `r_k`, the
  ratio of `B_2k / (2k)!` to `B_(2k-2) / (2k - 2)!`, read from the shared record;
- `N^(-1/2) (cos(pi Q) Re C - sin(pi Q) Im C)`.

At `M = 20` the stage is 1,897 steps, the same program at every cell, `N` a field of its record. The
verdict reads it in place of the remainder, and the head is taken once, not doubled. `em_bounds` adds
Johansson's remainder, `theta`'s error through the head and `C`, and the device's arithmetic, carried
step by step through the reciprocal and each `tau_k`.

**The walk.** Each point's `Z` is a fix and its bound the error about it, and a point that clears its
bound is a certified sign. Where the count falls short, each cell with an uncertified point, or every
cell where none has one, runs again with four times the points and ten more terms, `N` with them,
until the count closes or the rounds run out.

**The run.** Cells 1 to 10 at 4 points or more a zero, `M = 20`, `N` from 21 at cell 1 to 255 at cell 10.
The bound on `Z` is `2.5 e-4` at cell 1, `3.9 e-6` at cell 2 and `6.0 e-10` at cell 10, and every
cell closes in round 0. The certified sign changes in `(6.283185, 760.265422]` number 460, and `N` is held
to one value at the top, `460 <= N(760.265422) <= 460`, every port check equal, in 305 seconds.

**Controls.**
- **The house's Z.** Against `em_at`, the exact value by `exact_zeta_zeros.py`'s two routes, the device
  meets it within `1.2 e-11` and `2.7 e-13` at two points of cell 1, and `9.4 e-16` and `1.6 e-15` at
  two of cell 10. The gap at cell 1 is `theta`'s omitted `7 / (5760 t^3)`, entering at second order:
  `exp(i theta) zeta(1/2 + i t) = Z` is real, and an error `delta` in `theta` moves its real part by
  `Z (cos(delta) - 1)`. At `t = 2 pi` that is `0.956 (4.9 e-6)^2 / 2`, `1.1 e-11`, and at `t = 12.17`
  it is `1.195 (6.7 e-7)^2 / 2`, `2.7 e-13`. The bound charges `delta` at first order.
- **Riemann-Siegel.** At the same two points of cell 10, entry 9's `Z` through `C_0` differs from this
  one by `9.6 e-4` and `2.5 e-4`, within the two bounds' sum, `1.012 e-3`, nearly all of it Gabcke's.
- **The port check.** The host's records equal the device's word for word, and its sums equal the
  device's, at every run.
- **Odlyzko's table.** Its first zero is 14.135, inside cell 1, and its zero 460 is 758.900.

**What it is not.** A verification of the hypothesis on `(0, 760.265422]`, by Johansson's and Brent's
bounds and entry 9's `N(760.265422)`, which stands on Trudgian's and Gabcke's. The published
verifications reach far past it. Its rigor is that of the bounds it cites, and of the step-by-step
bound on the device's arithmetic in `em_bounds`.

## Entry 15: the zeros to 6295757.960979, by the multiple evaluation under one cost

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_turing.py`, entry 9's machine with the main sum by the multiple
evaluation and each cell's lattice chosen by `Control`.

**The claim.** Every zero of zeta with ordinate in `(565486.677646, 6295757.960979]` lies on the critical
line and is simple: 11,906,477 of them. With entries 9 and 14, every zero in `(0, 6295757.960979]`,
12,843,158 of them.

**The lattice from one cost.** A cell at `2^p` points holds `r = 2^p / Z` points a zero, `Z` the rise
of `theta / pi` across it. Two zeros closer than a step hide between the same two points. Under the
spacing of the GUE, small gaps `g` come at density `(pi^2 / 3) g^2`, and the zeros a cell hides number
`mu = c Z / r^3 = c Z^4 / 8^p`, `c = pi^2 / 18`.
- A cell that hides one runs again, and the cost of closing it from `p` is
  `C(p) = T(p) + (1 - exp(-mu(p))) C(p + 1)`, with `T(p)` the time a run at `2^p` points takes.
- `T(p) = f + a 2^p`, `f` and `a` fit by least squares to the runs timed.
- `c` is the ratio of the zeros missed to the sum of `Z / r^3` over the cells measured, from the GUE's
  value with the weight of 4 cells' misses. A cell's misses are the shortfall `N` holds it to.
- `p` is the least `C`, moved at most one from the last cell's.

None of it touches the proof: the count certifies whatever lattice a cell runs on.

**The widths from the input.** Every width is set from the cell before any program is built, each at
a floor or wider, and no input is refused.
- **The held width:** 80 bits, or `60 + l` where the multiple evaluation's top level `l = p - beta`
  asks. There `|1 / D| <= 2^l / (6 pi) < 2^(l - 4)`, held at the scale `2^62` in `63 + l - 4` bits.
- **`nu`'s width:** the bits of the widest `k`.
- **`s`'s width:** the bits of `(nu + 1)^2`, plus `p`, plus 2.
- **A pair's lanes:** the larger of the bits of the pieces times the terms, plus 1, and `p`.
- **The multiple evaluation's lanes:** below `8 P`, and below its leaves' and near field's count.

The port check does not see a width. The host runs the same program at the same widths, and a value
wrapped by a width too narrow is wrapped alike on both. At `2^22` points a held width of 76 bits wraps
`1 / D` at the top level: `Z` moves by up to 3.378, zeros drop out of the count, and the records still
agree word for word. The check that sees it is the second method. Cell 300 at `2^22` points, by pairs and
by the multiple evaluation at the widths above, gives 6,859 zeros past `F` both ways, `Z` apart by
`5.159 e-11` at most.

**The run.** Cells 299 to 1001, each on the lattice `Control` picks: `2^17` points at 12 cells, `2^18`
at 192, `2^19` at 153 and `2^20` at 346. The cells that fall short run again at the least `C` past
their last lattice. A cell whose device run fails runs once more.

| round | zeros certified | cells short | points where `N` is not one value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 11,906,359 | 103 | 54 |
| 1 | 11,906,459 | 18 | 9 |
| 2 | 11,906,475 | 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 11,906,477 | 0 | 0 |

`936,681 <= N(565486.677646) <= 936,681` and `12,843,158 <= N(6295757.960979) <= 12,843,158`, every port
check equal, in 3,840 seconds. `c` starts at `0.548` and holds `0.697` at cell 1001. The bound on `Z` is
`6.30 e-6` at cell 299 and `3.06 e-6` at cell 1001.

**Controls.**
- **The house's Z.** At two points of cell 299, the device meets the house's main sum and remainder
  within `3.6 e-13` and `9.9 e-13`.
- **The two methods.** Cell 300 at `2^22` points, above.
- **The port check.** The host's records equal the device's word for word, and its sums equal the
  device's, at every run.

**What it is not.** A verification of the hypothesis on `(0, 6295757.960979]`, by Turing's method and
the published bounds of entries 9 and 14. The published verifications reach far past it. Its rigor is
that of the bounds it cites, and of the step-by-step bound on the device's arithmetic.

## Entry 16: the misses, mapped from the walker

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_miss_map.py`, over entry 15's device programs with every point listed.

**The walker.** On the line, `Z = 2 Re w + R` with `w = exp(i theta) F`: the carrier `exp(i theta)` and
the main sum `F`. A cell's points trace `w` in the plane.
- **Radius:** `|w|`.
- **Turn:** the angle from one step to the next.
- **Ground speed:** the length of a step.

A coarse lattice takes every `k`-th point of a fine one. A miss is a pair of zeros the fine lattice
certifies between two coarse points of one sign.

**The map.** Each miss is placed from the walker at the coarse point before it, heading 0.
- **The steady arc.** From the last two coarse steps, the arc that keeps turning at the same rate:
  tangent `heading exp(i phi / 2)`, and arc over chord `(phi / 2) / sin(phi / 2)`.
- **Bearing and distance.** The miss's bearing from the heading, and its distance in steps.
- **Distance from the arc.** Where the miss stands off that arc, in steps.

Every quantity is read in the walker's own frame: a heading that swings carries the map with it.

**Measured**, cells 300 to 339, `2^15` points against `2^18`, 820 misses.
- **Radius:** the misses' median radius is 0.60, against 1.27 over every point. 33.4% of the misses lie
  in the smallest tenth of radii.
- **Turn:** 35.7% of the misses lie in the largest tenth of turns.
- **Bearing:** the median bearing is 38°.
- **From the arc:** a median 0.10 of a step, mostly along the track and behind.

**The heights an e-fold apart.** In `t`, an e-fold is `nu -> sqrt(e) nu`. 40 cells from each of cells
300, 495 and 815, each coarse lattice at about 4.7 points a zero, 3,919 misses, 0 host checks failed.

| | `e^0` | `e^1` | `e^2` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `t` at the first cell | `5.655 e5` | `1.540 e6` | `4.173 e6` |
| points a zero, coarse | 4.760 | 4.766 | 4.668 |
| misses a thousand zeros | 4.428 | 4.311 | 4.798 |
| median radius | 1.2733 | 1.2801 | 1.2864 |
| inertia, the mean of `|w|^2` | 6.3461 | 6.8223 | 7.3046 |
| the sum of `1/n` to `nu` | 6.3449 | 6.8211 | 7.3046 |
| misses' radius over the median | 0.483 | 0.473 | 0.461 |
| misses in the smallest tenth of radii | 31.0% | 34.0% | 33.2% |
| median turn a step | 0.628 | 0.626 | 0.639 |
| misses' turn over the median | 1.213 | 1.229 | 1.236 |
| misses in the largest tenth of turns | 35.5% | 36.3% | 38.5% |
| bearing from the heading, median | 35.5° | 35.2° | 36.2° |
| distance from the arc, steps, median | 0.093 | 0.095 | 0.092 |
| pull from the arc: length, bearing | 0.380 at 171° | 0.396 at 173° | 0.378 at 166° |
| misses | 654 | 1,109 | 2,156 |

- **The inertia meets its law.** The mean of `|w|^2` is the sum of `1/n` to `nu`, within `1.2 e-3` at each
  height. `|w| = |F|`, and the mean of `|F|^2` over `t` is the sum of the squared coefficients, the cross
  terms averaging out: the mean value theorem of Montgomery and Vaughan, reported and not read here. It
  rises by 0.476 and then 0.482, the sum of `1/n` over the cells between.
- **What holds still.** The bearing, the distance from the arc and the pull from it hold to within a few
  percent over two e-folds, while the inertia rises by 0.96.
- **What moves, one way.** The misses' radius over the median falls, and their turn over the median and
  their share of the largest tenth of turns rise. Three heights do not tell a slow law from noise.

**The scatter as the walk's check.** Posit, Doug's:
- The scatter is the walk's early warning. It shows whether the walk follows the smooth natural
  fractal correctly, even where the fractal's direction changes sharply.
- A far miss may not be a miss. It may be the peak of a curl of the fractal, at a distance the walk has
  not reached. The target is 99.999% of the zeros directly under the walk, and seeing zeros off it does
  not mean the walk is wrong.
- More and more isolated dots, while the bulk of the zeros converges under the walk, indicate
  convergence.

What the map reads of them:
- **Under us:** the share of misses within one step of the arc.
- **The far misses' radius, turn and dip radius,** each over its height's median. A miss past a step is
  read as a curl of the field at a scale the walk has not reached.
- **The separation:** the far misses' median distance from the arc over the 90th percentile of the
  near ones. It rises as the near ones close in and the far ones stand apart.
- **The pickle:** each miss's distance from the arc split into along-track, parallel to the heading,
  and cross-track, across it. The width is the cross-track RMS, and the aspect is the width over the
  along-track RMS. A carrier locked to the zeros' rhythm narrows the width first; the along-track then
  contracts and the share under us rises, as Doug posits: narrow the scatter first, and it then starts
  to shrink.

**Measured**, the convergence rows at the same three heights (`2^15` coarse against `2^18` fine), 0 host
checks failed:

| | `e^0` | `e^1` | `e^2` |
|---|---|---|---|
| under us, within a step | 99.694% | 99.279% | 99.119% |
| distance from the arc, steps, tenth | 0.022 | 0.026 | 0.024 |
| distance from the arc, steps, ninetieth | 0.309 | 0.311 | 0.314 |
| the pickle's width, cross-track RMS | 0.096 | 0.103 | 0.131 |
| along-track RMS | 0.201 | 0.208 | 0.231 |
| the pickle's aspect, cross over along | 0.477 | 0.496 | 0.567 |
| far misses over the core's ninetieth | 9.07 | 4.47 | 5.42 |

- The scatter is already about two to one along the track, the misses sitting behind the walker, and
  the aspect widens slowly with height (0.477 to 0.567). The share under us holds above 99.1%, and the
  far misses stand four to nine times past the core: single dots, not a smear.

A height's 600 to 2,200 misses read the share under us to about a tenth of a percent. A share of
99.999% is read from `10^5` misses or more.

**Measured**, the carrier as a sampling grid (`carrier` mode, cells 300 to 309 on one fine lattice each,
the coarse lattice placed six ways at the same rate, 0 host checks failed). The metallic combs are built
as the coarse spacing: the comb `1, 1, 2` as a period-3 gap pattern, golden and silver as the Sturmian
word of their slope, each against the uniform lattice and a shuffled null.

| scheme | width, cross-track RMS | under us | misses |
|---|---|---|---|
| uniform | 0.099 | 97.0% | 166 |
| comb `1, 1, 2` | 0.263 | 61.9% | 281 |
| golden `1, 1, 1` | 0.118 | 86.1% | 216 |
| silver `2, 2, 2` | 0.343 | 40.6% | 372 |
| null, comb shuffled | 0.149 | 75.4% | 280 |
| null, golden shuffled | 0.091 | 92.5% | 214 |

- The result is against the posit. As a sampling grid the metallic rhythm widens the pickle and loses
  misses under us, not narrows it. Every comb catches more misses than the uniform lattice and pushes
  more past a step. The ordered comb is worse than its own shuffle (0.263 against 0.149; 0.118 against
  0.091): the rhythm concentrates misses, it does not spread them.
- The cause is the gap variance: a non-uniform lattice at one mean rate has longer gaps than the
  uniform one, and a longer coarse gap hides more pairs and defeats the steady arc the placing extends
  across it. Golden, the flattest comb, is the least hurt; silver and the comb, with the longest gaps,
  the most.
- The reading: the carrier is not a sampling grid. Its role as the posits set it, a known reference to
  read `w` against, is a readout under a lattice chosen to catch zeros, not the lattice itself. The
  grid wants to be uniform or denser where the dips are, not quasiperiodic.

The share under us is raised by a lattice denser where it misses, the dip-driven control of the open
list, not by a carrier grid.

**The filter built to trap.** Posit, Doug's: a filter that concentrates misses is built wrong. It is
to be built to trap the zeros between its peaks.
- **The construction.** A zero of `Z` is where `Re(w)` crosses `-R/2`, near the imaginary axis; an
  antinode, `|Z|` near a lobe's peak, is where `Im(w)` crosses zero, the real axis. As `w` winds the two
  alternate, and a lattice at the `Im(w)` crossings holds a zero between each pair of its peaks.
- **Measured** (`carrier` mode, cells 300 to 309, 69,789 zeros, 0 host checks failed):

  | lattice | points | hidden zeros a thousand | floor |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | uniform at 4.7 points a zero | 327,680 | 4.8 | |
  | antinode, `Im(w) = 0` | 46,345 | 368 | 336 |
  | uniform, the antinode's point count | 46,579 | 668 | 333 |

  The floor is the pigeonhole bound: a lattice with fewer intervals than zeros shows at most one zero an
  interval, and hides at least the zeros less the intervals. At one density the antinode lattice hides
  9% past its floor, and the uniform lattice twice its floor. The peaks land between the zeros.
- **Why only 0.66 peaks a zero.** Derived: `Z' = -2 theta' Im(w) + 2 Re(exp(i theta) F') + R'`, with
  `theta' = (1/2) ln(t / 2 pi)`. `Im(w) = 0` is `Z' = 0` only where the `F'` term is small, and `F'/F` is
  largest where `|F|` is small, the small radii where the misses gather (entry 16, the radius rows).
  `w` crosses the imaginary axis 1.5 times for each crossing of the real axis: it does not wind
  monotonically, `F`'s own rotation running against the carrier's.
- **The exact filter.** Derived, Rolle: `Z` is monotone between consecutive zeros of `Z'`, and holds at
  most one zero there. A lattice at the zeros of `Z'` hides no pair, unconditionally, and shows each zero
  as a sign change between two critical points. `F'` by the multiple evaluation with each charge
  weighted by `ln k` gives `Z'` on the device.
- **Prior art.** Lagarias (Acta Arith. 120, 2005, read pp. 1-6, [zeta_prior_art.md](zeta_prior_art.md)):
  `A_h = Re xi(1/2 + h + i t)` and `B_h = -Im xi(1/2 + h + i t)` have every zero on the line, simple, and
  interlaced, for `h >= 1/2` unconditionally and for every `h > 0` under RH. Derived, Cauchy-Riemann: as
  `h -> 0+`, `A_h -> Xi` and `B_h / h -> Xi'`, and the interlacing of `A_h` with `B_h` becomes the
  interlacing of `Xi`'s zeros with its critical points. Rolle gives one critical point between two
  zeros at least; exactly one, no wiggle, is the Laguerre-Polya property RH gives `Xi` (from knowledge).
- **The drag on the clock.** Posit, Doug's: the 9% past the floor is a drag on the carrier's clock not
  yet in the model, and is to be added. Its candidate is the angular momentum itself, rippling the
  anisotropic plane as paper ripples on a table.
  Derived: with `w = |F| exp(i phi)` and `phi = theta + arg F`, `Z = 2 |F| cos(phi)` past `R`, and
  `Z' = 2 |F| ((ln |F|)' cos(phi) - phi' sin(phi))`. The antinode lattice reads the clock as `theta`
  alone. Two terms of `F'` move the peak off it: `F`'s own turning, `phi' = theta' + (arg F)'`, the
  angular momentum, which runs against the carrier where `|F|` is small; and the swell of its size,
  `(ln |F|)'`, the plane lifting, which sets the peak at `tan(phi) = (ln |F|)' / phi'` in place of
  `phi = k pi`.
- **Measured, the trap with the drag added** (`carrier` mode, cells 300 to 309, 69,789 zeros, the
  turning points of `Z` on the fine lattice, 0 host checks failed):

  | lattice | points | points a zero | hidden zeros a thousand | floor |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | antinode, `Im(w) = 0` | 46,345 | 0.664 | 368 | 336 |
  | turning points, `Z' = 0` | 69,807 | 1.0003 | 0 | 0 |
  | uniform, the turning lattice's point count | 70,294 | 1.007 | 319 | 0 |

  Turning points on the wrong side of zero, a positive minimum or a negative maximum: 0. Between each
  two zeros `Z` turns once and only once, and the points past one a zero are the cells' ends. The drag
  is all of it: with `F`'s turning and swell added, the trap holds every zero at one point a zero, where
  a uniform lattice of the same count hides 319 a thousand.
- **Bounds.** The turning points are read from the fine lattice, at least 38 points a zero: a turn
  narrower than a fine step is not seen, and by Rolle the fine lattice hides no pair between its own
  turning points by construction. The reading is the count, one turn a gap with none wasted. The trap at
  coarse cost wants `Z'` from `F'` on the device, located without the fine lattice. Exactly one
  critical point of `Z` between consecutive zeros for large `t` is the form a statement under RH takes,
  `Z'/Z` decreasing between zeros from the Hadamard product (from knowledge, not read).
- **The ripples and their waves.** Posit, Doug's: the ripples in the surface account for much of the
  noise, through their harmonics. A swell of the magnitude is coupled directly to the ball's angular
  momentum, its twist above all, and casts off sharply peaked waves, parabolic at the top and ovoid in
  shape.
  Derived: where `F` passes near a zero of its own, `t* = gamma + i delta` off the real `t` axis,
  `d/dt ln F = 1 / (t - t*)`. Its real part is the swell, `(ln |F|)' = u / (u^2 + delta^2)` with
  `u = t - gamma`, and its imaginary part the twist, `(arg F)' = delta / (u^2 + delta^2)`: one pole, the
  two coupled by Cauchy-Riemann. The twist is a Lorentzian of height `1 / delta`, width `delta` and turn
  `pi`, a parabola at its top, and `(swell, twist)` runs a circle of diameter `1 / delta` through the
  origin, a line inverted. `F`'s neighbors and its curve press the circle to an egg. A twist past
  `theta'`, `delta < 1 / theta'`, runs the clock back.
- **Measured, the ripples** (`ripple` mode, cells 300 to 309, the 166 misses of the uniform lattice at
  4.76 points a zero, 0 host checks failed). F's drag and swell at the misses' dips against every
  seventh fine point:

  | reading | every point, 10 / 50 / 90 | the misses' dips, 10 / 50 / 90 |
  |---|---|---|
  | drag, `phi' / theta'` | 0.078 / 0.621 / 1.152 | -0.027 / 0.008 / 0.214 |
  | swell, `\|(ln \|F\|)'\| / theta'` | 0.049 / 0.281 / 0.962 | 0.229 / 0.782 / 3.076 |
  | clock running back, `phi' < 0` | 8.77% | 30.72% |

  At the median miss the clock stands still, and the plane swells at 2.8 times its median. The lock of
  the misses' times on each beat `ln(n / m)` of `|F|^2`, by Rayleigh's `z = n R^2`, the chance of so
  tight a lock among uniform phases near `exp(-z)`:

  | beat | `R` | direction | `z` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `ln 2` | 0.108 | 214 | 1.94 |
  | `ln 3` | 0.299 | 175 | 14.82 |
  | `ln 3/2` | 0.069 | 283 | 0.79 |
  | `ln 4` | 0.120 | 148 | 2.39 |
  | `ln 4/3` | 0.016 | 243 | 0.04 |
  | `ln 5` | 0.168 | 178 | 4.67 |
  | `ln 5/2` | 0.031 | 14 | 0.16 |
  | `ln 6` | 0.102 | 356 | 1.72 |
  | null, 0.5 / 0.9 / 1.3 / 1.9 / 2.3 | 0.02 to 0.13 | | 0.07 to 2.83 |

  The misses lock on `ln 3`, at 175 degrees, where `cos(t ln 3) = -1` and that beat takes from `|F|`,
  past any null by a factor of five in `z`, and on `ln 5` at 178 degrees more weakly. `ln 2`, the
  largest beat, does not lock. Why the odd beats and not `ln 2` is open.
- **Measured, the waves** (`pulse` mode, the same cells). Each local minimum of `|F|` with
  `delta = |F| / |F'|` under `1 / theta'` and at least four fine steps, read over four `delta` each side:

  | against the single pole | 10 / 50 / 90 | the pole |
  |---|---|---|
  | `delta theta'` | 0.234 / 0.492 / 0.807 | under 1 |
  | peak twist times `delta` | 0.988 / 0.999 / 1.019 | 1 |
  | the loop's diameter over `1 / delta`, its low tenth | 0.390 / 0.632 / 0.996 | 1 |
  | the loop's diameter over `1 / delta`, its high tenth | 0.982 / 1.023 / 1.636 | 1 |
  | the swell's lead over its trail | 0.648 / 1.001 / 1.542 | 1 |
  | the turn over the window, over `2 atan(4)` | 0.198 / 1.359 / 1.957 | 1 |

  16,919 pulses pass the clock, 0.24 a zero: 10,236 turn against `theta` and run the clock back, and
  6,683 turn with it and spin it past twice its rate. The peak twist times `delta` is 1 by identity at a
  minimum of `|F|`, where the swell is 0 and `|F'/F|` is the twist: the reading says the twist peaks
  at the minimum, and the top is the pole's parabola. The loop is the egg: at its crown the diameter is
  the circle's, 1.02, and on its flanks it falls to 0.63, the tails dropping faster than the
  Lorentzian's. The egg leans either way, the swell's lead over its trail 1.00 at the median and 0.65
  to 1.54 between the tenths. The turn over the window is wide, the window reaching a zero's spacing
  and the next pulse inside it.
  The misses sit in the waves: 125 of the 166 (75.3%) fall inside a pulse, and the pulses cover 31.6%
  of the fine points.
- **The program holds, the surface hides.** Posit, Doug's: the cause of the misses is known. The
  surface's geometry deforms as it is walked, while the fractal program does not change and follows its
  curves exactly; the deformation of the surface hides the zeros.
  Derived: `Z = 2 |F| cos(phi) + R`, `phi = theta + arg F`, and `theta` is monotone, `theta' = ln x`.
  Two zeros inside one coarse step want `phi` to cross a level and run back across it, `phi' < 0`, or to
  sweep `pi` inside the step, `phi'` at least the rate times `theta'`. `theta` does neither; only the
  twist of `F` past `theta'` does. `R` moves the level by `R / (2 |F|)`, largest where `|F|` dents, and
  is the way left.
- **Measured, each miss across its two zeros** (`pulse` mode, the same cells, the 166 misses):

  | across the two zeros | misses |
  |---|---|
  | the clock runs back, `phi' < 0` | 155 |
  | the clock spins past 4.76 `theta'` | 10 |
  | neither | 1 |

  165 of the 166 are the surface's twist. The one left reaches 1.50 `theta'` at most between its zeros,
  the level's move by `R / (2 |F|)` the way derived for it, not yet read.
- **The sources of the waves.** Posit, Doug's: with the wave's shape known where it is made, its
  harmonics locate the wave's origin, show whether the origins form a regular interference pattern, and
  predict where seiches will occur.
  Derived: each pulse places its source, the zero of `F` at `t* = gamma + i delta`: `gamma` where `|F|`
  is least, `|delta| = |F| / |F'|` there, its side the sign of the twist. `F` is a sum of exponentials
  with frequencies `ln n` to `ln N`, near `theta'`, and Langer's count puts its zeros in a strip, about
  `L ln N / 2 pi` in a length `L`: one source for each two zeros of `Z` (from knowledge, not read). The
  Dirichlet coefficients of `log F` at `n` are fixed by `F`'s at the divisors of `n`, and `F`'s are
  `zeta`'s to `N`: `F'/F` carries `-Lambda(n) n^(-1/2)` at the frequency `ln n` for every `n` up to `N`,
  lines at the prime powers and none elsewhere. This is Landau's formula, read for the zeros of `F` in
  place of `zeta`'s ([zeta_prior_art.md](zeta_prior_art.md)).
- **Measured, the sources** (`source` mode, the same cells, 69,789 zeros of `Z`, 0 host checks failed).
  28,901 sources, 0.414 a zero against Langer's 0.5; a source far from the line leaves no minimum of
  `|F|` to read. 22,319 sit within `1 / theta'` of the line, 0.320 a zero, 58% of them turning against
  `theta`. Their `gamma`s locked on each beat:

  | beat | `Lambda(n) n^(-1/2)` | `R` | direction | `z` |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `ln 2` | 0.490 | 0.135 | 181.0 | 404 |
  | `ln 3` | 0.634 | 0.172 | 180.4 | 659 |
  | `ln 4` | 0.347 | 0.082 | 178.2 | 150 |
  | `ln 5` | 0.720 | 0.174 | 179.9 | 679 |
  | `ln 6` | 0 | 0.009 | 355.2 | 1.7 |
  | `ln 5/2` | 0 | 0.006 | 342.2 | 0.8 |
  | `ln 3/2` | 0 | 0.034 | 3.8 | 26 |
  | `ln 4/3` | 0 | 0.022 | 6.1 | 11 |
  | null, 0.5 / 0.9 / 1.3 / 1.9 / 2.3 | | 0.001 to 0.008 | | 0.04 to 1.4 |

  The sources lock on the prime powers at 180 degrees, Landau's sign, and `R` runs with
  `Lambda(n) n^(-1/2)`: `ln 3` over `ln 2` is 1.28 against 1.29. `ln 6` does not lock, `Lambda(6) = 0`.
  `ln 3/2` and `ln 4/3` lock weakly, past the null and two orders under the prime lines: the choice of
  sources by `delta`, a function of `|F|`, carries `|F|^2`'s beats.
- **Measured, the seiches.** The sources' density read from `F'/F` cut at `k`,
  `-(sum over n to k of Lambda(n) n^(-1/2) cos(t ln n))`, against `|F|` cut at its first `k` harmonics;
  the share of the 166 misses and of the 22,319 sources in the fifth each places highest, a fifth where
  it places nothing:

  | to `k` | `\|F_k\|` lowest fifth, misses | `F'/F` lines highest fifth, misses | the same, sources |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 3 | 31.9% | 33.1% | 28.2% |
  | 6 | 27.7% | 38.0% | 31.5% |
  | 10 | 23.5% | 34.9% | 33.1% |
  | 20 | 27.1% | 50.0% | 38.9% |
  | 40 | 39.8% | 63.9% | 43.8% |

  The prime lines place the seiches, and better with each line added: to 40, 64% of the misses fall in
  the fifth they mark, 3.2 times a fifth. `|F|`'s own harmonics place them barely past a fifth. The
  lines run to `N`, 300 here, and the reading past 40 is open.
- **The primes from the waves.** Posit, Doug's: the engine proves primes very fast. That validates the
  waves' origins, and the harmonics then predict the primes' locations and their distribution. The
  validator is Proth's witness,
  [twiddle-proof.md](twiddle-proof.md): `a^((N-1)/2) = -1 mod N` proves `N = k 2^n + 1`, `k < 2^n`,
  prime in one exponentiation, and a failed witness proves it composite.
  Derived, the two readings and what each can claim:
  - The sources of `F` read back `F`'s own coefficients. `log F` has `zeta`'s to `N` by construction,
    and the primes to `N` found in the sources check that the sources are placed right; they are not a
    prediction.
  - The zeros of `Z` are `zeta`'s, certified. By Landau, for every `x > 1` the zeros in a window
    `[T1, T2]` sum to `sum of x^(i gamma) = -((T2 - T1) / 2 pi) Lambda(x) / sqrt(x)`, its error of order
    `log T` and not a random walk's. With a Hann taper `w` over the window,
    `D(x) = -(4 pi / (T2 - T1)) sqrt(x) sum of w cos(gamma ln x)` reads `Lambda(x)`, the integers apart
    while `x` is under `(T2 - T1) / 4 pi`. Every main sum in the window stops at `N`; a prime past `N`
    read from the zeros is not in any of them.
- **Measured, the primes** (`primes` mode, cells 300 to 309, 0 host checks failed).
  The wave origins: the 22,319 sources within `1 / theta'` of the line locked on `ln n` for every `n`
  from 2 to `N = 309`. All 80 prime powers lock at 180 degrees within 30, Landau's sign; 69 of them
  lock past every other `n`, and 11 do not. The other 228 `n` lock at a median `z` of 0.25 and at most
  30.0, the prime powers at a median of 102.7 and at least 2.3. `R` over `Lambda(n) n^(-1/2)` holds near one constant, 0.158 to
  0.225 between the tenths, median 0.173.
  The primes past `N`: the 69,789 certified zeros of `Z` in `[565486.874, 603813.576]` read `D(x)` at
  every integer to 3,049, and each `x` with `D(x)` past `ln 2 / 2` is called a prime power:

  | `x` | prime powers | called | right | false | missed | `D / Lambda`, median |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 2 to 309, to `N` | 80 | 80 | 80 | 0 | 0 | 1.000 |
  | 310 to 1,000 | 113 | 113 | 113 | 0 | 0 | 1.000 |
  | 1,001 to 2,000 | 140 | 140 | 140 | 0 | 0 | 1.000 |
  | 2,001 to 3,049 | 140 | 141 | 140 | 1 | 0 | 1.000 |

  Past `N`, ten times past it, every prime power is called and one integer that is not: 2,550, `D`
  0.416, between the twin primes 2,549 and 2,551. There the window parts integers 0.84 of a step apart,
  and the two lobes add. `D / Lambda` at the prime powers runs 0.998 to 1.002 between the 1st and 99th
  percentiles; `|D|` elsewhere has a median of 0.001, a 99th percentile of 0.184, and 0.416 at most,
  at 2,550. The 15 calls
  past `N` that Proth's theorem reaches carry their certificates, 14 proved prime and 1 proved
  composite, a prime power, and none of the 15 against the sieve. The distribution, the sum of `D`
  to `x` against `psi(x)`:

  | `x` | `psi(x)` | sum of `D` |
  |---|---|---|
  | 100 | 94.05 | 94.05 |
  | 500 | 501.65 | 501.68 |
  | 1,000 | 996.68 | 996.68 |
  | 2,000 | 1,994.45 | 1,995.07 |
  | 3,000 | 3,001.09 | 3,002.73 |

  The certified zeros of ten cells place the primes and count them, to an integer's width, to 3,049.
  Reading `psi` from the zeros is Riemann's explicit formula; the reading here is Landau's, at each
  integer, from a window of zeros the engine certified itself.
- **The twist on the device.** `F'` is the multiple evaluation again, over the same poles with `a` and
  every charge times `-i ln k / 2^c`, `d/dt k^(-it) = -i ln k k^(-it)`, and `2^c` at least `ln nu`
  keeps every charge at most `F`'s, inside every width that holds `F`. A twist stage turns it by
  `exp(i theta)` beside `w`, and their ratio is `F'/F`: the twist `(arg F)'` its imaginary part, the
  swell `(ln |F|)'` its real part, at every point (`exact_zeta_turing.cu`, listing word 2). It places no
  point and certifies no sign.
- **The flag from one point.** Derived: Newton's step `t* = t - F/F'` places the nearest source from a
  single coarse point, exactly for a single pole. A source at `gamma + i delta` runs the clock back where
  `delta < 0` and `u^2 < |delta| / theta' - delta^2`, and spins a coarse step's `pi` past it where
  `delta > 0` and `u^2 < delta / ((r - 1) theta') - delta^2`, `r` the points a zero. A coarse step is
  flagged where that stretch, from a source placed at either end, meets it. Nothing in the rule is
  fitted.
- **Measured, the twist** (`twist` mode, cells 300 to 309, the uniform lattice at 4.76 points a zero,
  327,670 coarse steps, the 166 misses, 0 host checks failed). The device's `F'/F` against the fine
  lattice's own differences of `w`, over `theta'`: 0.00007 at the median, 0.0017 at the 90th
  percentile, 0.063 at the 99th, the tail where the differences fail at the dips.

  | flag | steps flagged | misses caught |
  |---|---|---|
  | source inside the step, `\|delta\| theta' < 0.5` | 5.4% | 36 (21.7%) |
  | the same, under 1 | 12.6% | 99 (59.6%) |
  | the same, under 2 | 24.3% | 129 (77.7%) |
  | the pole's own stretch | 18.8% | 165 (99.4%) |

  The pole's own rule catches 165 of the 166 at 18.8% of the steps, where steps taken by lot at that
  share catch 18.8%. The coarse lattice with `F'` at its points names the steps that can hide a pair,
  and the fine lattice is wanted in those alone: the dip-driven control of the open list, with the
  flag from the device.
- **The slide.** Posit, Doug's: the miss the pole rule leaves is the ball sliding while it spins; it
  loses its grip for a moment, and the forces decouple entirely. The slides come on extreme changes of
  course. Rules are to be relational, one motion against another, not set at a threshold: where the
  momentum is 1 and the angle 0, the coupling is 1. The turn at a miss is an orbital slingshot.
  Measured, the miss left, across its two zeros: the drag 0.93 to 1.50, the clock steady; the swell
  -6.3 to -1.1 over `theta'`, `|F|` falling from 0.147 to 0.033; the level `R / (2 |F|)` rising from
  0.17 to 0.76 while `cos(phi)` turns through -0.71 to -0.16. The zeros are `cos(phi) = -R / (2 |F|)`,
  and the level, driven by the falling `|F|`, sweeps across the slow phase twice. The grip `|F|` came
  to within 0.76 of letting go.
  Derived, the coupling: `zeta = (w'/w) / (i theta') = 1 + (F'/F) / (i theta')`, the ball's motion in
  the carrier's units, `|zeta|` its momentum and `arg zeta` its course off the tangent. `zeta = 1` is
  the ball rolling with the carrier, the coupling whole. Running back is `Re zeta < 0`, the spin past
  is `|zeta|` past the points a zero, the slide is `arg zeta` near a right angle, and at a source
  `|zeta|` runs to infinity, the forces decoupled. Its distance from 1 is the surface's whole share,
  `(F'/F) / (i theta')`, from the device at every point.
  Derived, the slingshot: near a source `F ~ c (t - t*)`, and the pass turns `arg F` by `pi` whatever
  the miss distance `|delta|`, at a rate `1 / |delta|` at its closest, `|F| = |c| |delta|`. A pass
  against the carrier inside `1 / theta'` turns the ball back for a moment; one with it throws the
  ball forward.
- **Measured, the coupling and the course** (`twist` mode, the same cells and misses, 0 host checks
  failed). At every 97th fine point and, for each miss, at its dip and at its farthest `zeta` across
  its zeros:

  | reading | every point | the misses |
  |---|---|---|
  | course off the tangent, median | 23.7 degrees | 89.0 degrees |
  | course past 60 degrees | 16.8% | 97.0% |
  | `\|zeta - 1\|`, median | 0.543 | 1.510 |
  | `Re zeta < 0`, the clock back | 8.8% | 93.4% |
  | `\|arg zeta\|` past 60 degrees | 16.8% | 95.2% |

  At the bottom of a miss the ball moves straight in or out, the turn of the slingshot, where the
  clock passes through zero and the swell is all the motion left.
- **Measured, the flags against each other**, of 327,670 coarse steps:

  | flag | steps flagged | misses caught |
  |---|---|---|
  | Hermite, the cubic through `Z` and `Z' = 2 Re(w (i theta' + F'/F))` at the step's two ends | 165 | 165 (99.4%) |
  | the pole's model, `F` linear through its source and the carrier at `theta'` | 10,526 | 141 (84.9%) |
  | the pole's own stretch | 61,455 | 165 (99.4%) |
  | the pole's stretch or Hermite | 61,456 | 166 (100%) |

  The Hermite flag reads the spin and the slide alike through `Z'`: of its 165 flagged steps, 165 hold
  a miss, and it leaves one miss. `R'` is left out of `Z'`.
  The miss it leaves is a Lehmer pair: its two zeros in neighboring fine steps, `|F|` 0.53 and the
  grip whole, the level 0.048, and the clock stopped at its turn, `zeta = -0.03 + 0.24 i`, with
  `cos(phi) = -0.048` on the level. `Z` touches the axis and leaves it, a dip too shallow for a cubic
  through the ends, and the pole's stretch holds it.
- **The pair as a figure.** Posit, Doug's: the ball, centered on its triangular plane and twisting with
  a slight downward momentum, gives the triangle a large moment in a downward twist, the first zero;
  its inertia carries it through the turn, the ball traces a rough figure eight, and the plane inverts
  again, the second zero; then the ball's twist comes back into line, it has angular momentum again,
  and the inversions settle. The figure eight is a Möbius strip: the ball still moves through space
  and never over its own path, which would break the fractal.
  Derived, the strip: in space-time, `(Re w, Im w, t)`, `t` only rises and the track is a ribbon about
  the `t` axis that never meets itself; a crossing in the plane of `w` is its shadow. A pass by a source
  turns `arg F` by `pi` whatever its miss distance, the Lorentzian's area, and the frame the ball
  carries leaves the pass turned over: a half twist, `cos(phi)` changing sign with it. A source with
  `delta < 0` twists against the carrier, with `delta > 0` with it, and a half twist each way leaves
  the frame as it was.
  Derived: the moment of inertia is `|w|^2 = |F|^2`, the angular momentum `L = Im(conj(w) w') =
  |F|^2 phi'`. The pair is `phi` crossing the level, `L` falling through 0, `phi` crossing back, and
  `L` rising again: the signs `+ - +`. `w = exp(i theta) F` is a deferent carrying a sum of epicycles
  `n^(-1/2) exp(-i t ln n)`, and where the epicycles outrun the deferent the track runs retrograde,
  the loops of a planet's apparent path (from knowledge). In the phase portrait `(Z, Z')` the track
  turns one way, and a turn the other way wants `Z` and `Z''` of one sign, a turning point on the
  wrong side of zero: a figure eight there and a wiggle are one event.
- **Measured, the figure** (`twist` mode, the same cells; each miss over its steps and one step each
  side, against 600 windows three steps long placed by lot):

  | reading | the misses, 166 | by lot, 600 |
  |---|---|---|
  | the track crosses itself, in `w` | 2.4% | 0.0% |
  | the same, in `F`, the frame turning with the carrier | 0.0% | 0.2% |
  | the same, in `(Z, Z' / theta')` | 0.0% | 0.0% |
  | `L`'s signs `- +` or `+ -`, part of a turn in the window | 74.0% | 14.8% |
  | `L`'s signs `+ - +`, the whole turn | 19.3% | 3.3% |
  | `L` of one sign, `+` | 6.6% | 81.7% |

  The momentum is handed off and taken back at the misses, `L` turning in 93% of them against 18% by
  lot. The inversion is a hairpin: the ball folds back over its track without crossing it, `|F|`
  changing as it turns, and a true loop shows in `w` at 4 of the 166. The figure eight in the phase
  portrait does not occur, the same count as the turning points of the trap, none on the wrong side of
  zero; for `Xi` its absence is the Laguerre-Polya property RH gives (from knowledge).
- **Measured, the half twist** (`twist` mode, the same cells, 0 host checks failed). At each minimum of
  `|F|` Newton's step places the source, and the device's twist summed over `u` in
  `[-3 |delta|, 3 |delta|]` is read against the single pass's `2 atan(3) sign(delta)`, about `0.80 pi`:

  | `\|delta\| theta'` | passes | the turn over the single pass's, 10 / 50 / 90 | its sign `delta`'s |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | under 0.25 | 5,885 | 0.82 / 1.10 / 1.24 | 100.0% |
  | 0.25 to 0.5 | 6,773 | 0.60 / 1.30 / 1.47 | 100.0% |
  | 0.5 to 1 | 8,255 | 0.21 / 1.53 / 1.82 | 97.8% |

  The side of the source sets the way of the half twist: all 12,658 passes within `0.5 / theta'` of the
  line turn as `delta`'s sign says. The sharpest turn the single pass's half twist, within a tenth at
  the median, and the wider gather more, the window `6 |delta|` taking in the neighbors' twist, and the
  excess runs the same way as the pass's own. Whether near sources lie on one side is open.
- **The slip at the crossover.** Posit, Doug's: the small miss is the ball slipping on the figure eight.
  There the ball is ruled by its center of mass, any perturbation can send it either way, and the
  field is noisy: noise is the dominant decider.
  Derived: the strip is edge-on where `cos(phi) = 0`, a quarter turn, and a stall is `phi' = 0`,
  `zeta` at its smallest. A ball stalled at the edge has no momentum to carry it, and whether `Z`
  crosses, and how far, is set by the smallest terms present: the level `R / (2 |F|)`, the far field of
  the other sources, and the device's bound. The noise is not drawn; it is `R`, known exactly, and its
  kind is the primes'.
- **Measured, the slip** (`twist` mode, the same cells; at each miss's dip, the slip `|Z| / (2 |F|)`, how
  far past the level the ball goes, against the level `|R| / (2 |F|)`, `cos(phi)` and the drag). The
  slip runs 0.0039 / 0.0209 / 0.0989 at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentiles.

  | | the shallowest quarter | the deepest quarter |
  |---|---|---|
  | `\|cos(phi)\|`, median, 0 edge-on | 0.016 | 0.106 |
  | `\|drag\|`, median, 0 stalled | 0.005 | 0.265 |
  | the zeros apart, fine steps, median | 6 | 10 |
  | the level `\|R\| / (2 \|F\|)`, median | 0.014 | 0.094 |
  | the slip over the level, median | 0.37 | 1.07 |

  The eight shallowest: the slip 0.00022 to 0.00175, `|cos(phi)|` 0.010 to 0.049, the drag within
  0.022 of zero, the zeros 0 to 3 fine steps apart, and the level 0.009 to 0.049, past the slip 10 to
  220 times. The shallow pairs are the ball stalled edge-on, and the remainder `R`, a few hundredths of
  `2 |F|`, decides them; in the deep pairs the slip and the level are alike. At the shallowest, `|Z|`
  at the dip is `2.3e-4`, past the bound on `Z` there, about `6e-6`: the device certifies its sign,
  and what decides the pair is `R`, not the arithmetic.
- **The flag in the machine.** Derived: a run of one sign between two certified points is certified
  again only where the Hermite flag trips on one of its steps, at eight times the points, by the pairs
  at the points listed (the device's method 4, `refine` in entry 15's machine). The flag chooses where
  to look and certifies nothing; each zero it adds lies between two certified fine points, and the
  sums take the earlier one's `x^2` rounded down to the cell's lattice and the later one's rounded up,
  which leaves both of Turing's bounds bounds. A pair the flag leaves makes its cell short, and the
  cell runs again on the whole lattice four times finer, as before.
- **Measured, the machine with the flag** (cells 300 to 309, 2^15 points a cell, 0 host checks
  failed):

  | | the transform alone | with the flag |
  |---|---|---|
  | runs flagged, points listed | | 165, 1,155 |
  | zeros certified at round 0 | 55,552 | 55,830 |
  | rounds of reruns | 2 | 1 |
  | zeros certified in `(T_a, T_b]` | 55,830 | 55,830 |
  | time | 73 s | 64 s |

  The 165 runs hold 330 zeros, a pair each. The miss the flag leaves, the Lehmer pair at
  `t = 599943.38`, lies past `T_b = 599924.82`. One cell is short at round 0 with every zero
  certified: Turing's bounds there want the finer lattice, and the rerun closes it.
- **The margin.** Derived: the cubic through `Z` and `Z'` at a step's ends stands within
  `h^4 / 384 max |M''''|` of the main sum `M` over the step, and
  `|M''''| <= 2 sum of n^(-1/2) (A^4 + 6 A^2 theta'' + 4 A |theta'''| + 3 theta''^2 + |theta''''|)`,
  `A = ln((nu + 1) / n)`. With the bound on `Z`, `Z'`'s error at the ends, `R`'s slope over the step
  and the roundings, it is the margin: where the cubic stays past it, `Z` holds one sign over the step,
  a proof and not a rate. On the device the cubic lies in the hull of its four Bezier points
  `z0, z0 + (h / 3) z0', z1 - (h / 3) z1', z1`, and a step whose four points all clear the margin is
  clean. A step that is not clean is listed again eight times finer, by pairs with their own `Z'`
  from the sums of `k^(-1/2) sin(phi)` and `k^(-1/2) ln k sin(phi)`, where the margin is 4096 times
  smaller, and again inside it where a fine step is not clean. Each halving takes the margin down 16
  times while the cubic's least value goes to `Z`'s, which ends one of two ways: the step is clean, or
  `Z`'s sign changes and the pair is found. A double zero alone would not end.
- **Three flips in one step.** Posit, Doug's: knowing how the plane flips, solve for the momentum
  three flips in a row would need. Derived: three zeros in a step need `Z'` to change sign twice in it.
  The cubic's slope `C'` is a quadratic with Bernstein points `z0'`, `(b2 - b1) / (h / 3)` and `z1'`, and
  `e = M - C_M` has `e'` zero at both ends and, by Rolle's theorem on `e`, once between:
  `|e'| <= max |M''''| / 6 times 4 h^3 / 27 = (2 / 81) h^3 max |M''''|`. Where all three Bernstein
  points run the way `Z` crosses past that, with `Z'`'s error, `3 / h` times `Z`'s, and `R`'s slope, `Z'`
  holds one sign over the step and the crossing is single. `Zh` is what it proves monotone; inside the
  band where `|Zh|` is within the bound on `Z`, about `1e-6` in `t`, Turing's count stands guard.
- **Measured, the margin** (cells 300 to 309, 2^15 points a cell, 0 host checks failed). The margin
  is `2.56e-3` at 2^15 points over cell 300 and `7.6e-6` at 2^18; the hull test flags the same steps as
  the cubic's least value against the margin, 667 on the host. With the single crossing, steps whose
  signs change and whose slope does not clear the steepness are flagged too: over cell 300, 25,865
  steps are clean, 6,573 single and 329 flagged, where the line through the end slopes, its error
  `h^2 / 8 max |M'''|`, left 1,142 flagged.

  | | the transform alone | the cubic's sign | the margin | the margin, `check` |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | steps flagged | | 165 | 669 | 3,304 |
  | points listed | | 1,155 | 6,021 | 29,824 |
  | zeros found in them | | 330 | 332 | 332 |
  | spans open after three passes | | | 0 | 1 |
  | rounds of reruns | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
  | zeros certified in `(T_a, T_b]` | 55,830 | 55,830 | 55,830 | 55,830 |
  | time | 73 s, 83 s | 64 s | 69 s | 98 s |

  The margin flags the Lehmer pair's step, and its two zeros are found at 2^18: cell 309 gives 7,100
  zeros past F where the cubic's sign gave 7,098. Of the crossings listed again, none hides three
  zeros; one span in cell 304 is still open after three passes, and Turing's count closes over it.
  Listing the crossings again costs 29 s here and adds no zero, and it runs as a check,
  `refine check`. Without it the device still reads every crossing: 66,820 of the 69,787 zeros past
  F, 95.7%, cross a coarse step proven single, and the run takes 67 s.
- **Measured, `Z'` two ways** (`both` with the listing word 2): `Z'` by the twist and by the pairs' sine
  sums at the same points differ by at most `8.5e-14`, `5.2e-13` and `5.9e-12` over cells 40, 120 and
  300, against the sums of their bounds, `4.7e-8`, `9.1e-8` and `5.5e-7`. The two derived bounds on
  `Z'`'s error hold here with five orders to spare; a difference past them would refute one.
- **The double zero.** Posit, Doug's: a double zero is the rare case where the ball inverts and rights
  while the plane itself turns with it; then there is no turning, the angular momentum all in phase.
  Derived: with `R` set aside, `Z = 2 |F| cos(phi)` and
  `Z' = 2 |F| (cos(phi) (ln |F|)' - sin(phi) phi')`, `phi' = theta' Re(zeta)`. A double zero is `Z` and
  `Z'` both 0 at one `t`: `cos(phi) = 0`, the ball edge-on, and `phi' = 0`, `Re(zeta) = 0`, the twist of
  `F` taking back the whole clock. `L = |F|^2 phi'` is 0 there: the ball and the plane turn together.
  The swell `w (ln |F|)'` runs along the edge, where `Z` reads it as 0. Two conditions at one `t` are met
  by no curve in general, only nearly; the Lehmer pair is that near approach, `Re(zeta) = -0.03` and
  `cos(phi) = -0.048`, and `R` decides it. The halvings a step needs grow as
  `log_16` of the margin over `|Z|`'s least value, a reading of how near a pair comes to a double zero.
- **Two gyroscopes.** Posit, Doug's: the plane spins so fast it precesses, and keeps double and triple
  zeros from happening; the plane and the ball are two gyroscopes, either acting on the other while
  coupled; the plane's mass is the ball, and its spin is bound by where on the triangle the ball is:
  at the center it can turn as fast as it likes, and the moment the ball leaves the center the plane
  is coupled to mass. The triangle's edges stretch as they need to.
  Derived: the plane's spin is `theta'`, set by `t` alone; the ball's is `(arg F)' = Im(F'/F)`, and the
  course `phi' = theta' + (arg F)'` couples them. `|(arg F)'| <= |F'| / |F|`: the ball's spin is capped
  inversely to its mass `|F|`, without a cap where `|F| = 0`, the ball on a source. The clock runs back,
  `Re(zeta) < 0`, only where the cap passes the plane's spin, `|F| < |F'| / theta'`.
- **Measured, the gyroscopes** (`transform` with the listing word 2, one cell an e-fold apart):

  | cell | `theta'` | `Re(zeta) < 0` | `\|F\|` 10 / 50 / 90 | `\|F\|` where `Re(zeta) < 0` | `\|F'\| / theta'`, median |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 300 | 5.705 | 8.58% | 0.39 / 1.27 / 3.83 | 0.20 / 0.61 / 1.48 | 0.761 |
  | 495 | 6.206 | 8.78% | 0.38 / 1.28 / 3.91 | 0.18 / 0.61 / 1.51 | 0.774 |
  | 815 | 6.704 | 9.19% | 0.39 / 1.29 / 4.01 | 0.19 / 0.62 / 1.48 | 0.781 |

  Where the clock runs back the ball is at half its usual distance from the center, in every cell:
  the mass holds the spin. The faster plane does not hold the stalls off here; the share of time the
  clock runs back rises with `theta'`, and the ball's torque `|F'| / theta'` rises with it, F taking
  more terms as the cells climb. Across these e-folds the two stay coupled.
- **The observer outside the sphere.** Posit, Doug's: the 90 degree limit is what an observer outside a
  sphere would see, watching the ball and the plane inside it, just as an opposing gyroscope works.
  Derived: on entry 8's sphere each wave `z_n = exp(i theta) n^(-1/2) n^(-it)` turns on its own
  circle at `theta' - ln n`, its radius fixed, and `Re <z, z'> = sum |z_n|^2 Re(i (theta' - ln n)) = 0`
  at every `t`: from outside, the point `(z_1, ..., z_nu)` moves at exactly 90 degrees to its radius,
  always. The deviations, the stall, the swell, the clock run back, are in the shadow
  `w = sum of z_n`, one complex dimension for `nu`. Each wave is an opposing pair, the plane forward at
  `theta'` against the wave back at `ln n`, its net `ln(x / n)`; a wave enters at `n = x` balanced, and
  spins up as `x` passes it.

**What it is not.** A map of where the coarse lattice loses zeros, against the fine lattice's count.
Every zero it places is certified by entry 15's machine. It claims nothing about the hypothesis.

## Entry 17: the machine's terms, its equation, and what it repeats

`examples/0_experimental/exact_zeta_turing.cu` and `exact_zeta_turing.py`, read for what each run
computes and what it computes again. The binary writes a `seconds` line: each phase, the loading of
programs, the host's checks, and of the loading the imprint and the layout.

**The equation.** For cell `nu` at `P = 2^p` points, point `j` stands at `S_j = nu^2 2^p + j (2 nu + 1)`,
`s_j = S_j / 2^p = x_j^2`, `t_j = 2 pi s_j`, and the machine evaluates

    Z(t_j) = 2 Re(exp(i theta_j) F_j) + R_j,      F_j = sum over k <= nu of k^(-1/2) exp(-i t_j ln k),
    Z'(t_j) = 2 (Re(exp(i theta_j) F'_j) - theta'_j Im(exp(i theta_j) F_j)),   F'_j = d F / d t,

and from them the certified signs, the zeros between them, Turing's sums, each step's hull against the
margin, and `N` held at every cell's `F` by Trudgian's bound. The proof is
`N(T_b) - N(T_a) <= the zeros certified in (T_a, T_b]`.

**The terms**, each where the device takes it, at `2^-62`:

| term | stage | lanes a cell | how |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ln k`, `k^(-1/2)` | pole | `nu` | `ln` folded to `f ln 2 + 2 artanh(y)`, `y <= 1/3`, 21 terms over up to 16 folds; the root by Newton's rule, 8 steps from a folded seed |
| `pos_k = (2 nu + 1) ln k`, `a_k = k^(-1/2) exp(-2 pi i nu^2 ln k)`, the charge `q_k` | pole | `nu` | three `cis` by the cosine series, 18 terms each, two complex products |
| `ln s_j`, `theta_j / pi = s ln s - s - 1/8 + 1 / (96 pi^2 s)` | point | `P` | `ln` folded over up to 33 folds, 21 terms |
| `x_j = s s^(-1/2)`, `z_j = 1 - 2 (x_j - nu)`, `x_j^(-1/2)`, `C_0(z_j)`, `R_j` | point | `P` | two roots by Newton's rule, 8 steps each from folded seeds; `C_0` by Horner's rule, 56 terms |
| `cos theta_j`, `sin theta_j` | point | `P` | the cosine series twice |
| `F_j` | the multiple evaluation | about `P` a stage | ten stages: the poles below each leaf, the leaf multipoles of order 28, their folds, the shifts up, across and down, the near field, the evaluation, the twiddles, Stockham's transform |
| the weighted poles `-i ln k / 2^c` times `a_k` and `q_k` | pole, again | `nu` | the whole pole stage again, then the product |
| `F'_j` | the multiple evaluation, again | about `P` a stage | the same ten stages over the weighted poles |
| `w_j`, `Z_j`, the sign, `theta / pi` bracketed | verdict | `P` | one complex product |
| the zeros, their `S` at each end | count | `P` | three verdict records a lane |
| `exp(i theta_j) F'_j`, `Z'_j` | twist, slope | `P` | one complex product, one real |
| the hull, clean, single, the flag | margin | `P - 1` | six products and comparisons |
| `k^(-1/2) cos(phi)`, `k^(-1/2) sin(phi)`, `k^(-1/2) ln k sin(phi)` at listed points | pair | `nu` a point | the cosine series twice a lane |

Steps a program: pole 1,520, point 1,834, verdict 60, count 43; the multiple evaluation's 15, 2,043,
336, 6,663, 9,716, 18,124, 659, 1,658, 297 and 38.

**Measured, where a run's time goes** (cell 300 at `2^15` points and cell 1000 at `2^17`, `seconds`):

| run | inside the binary | loading programs | of it, imprint and layout | the host's checks | the rest |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| cell 300, transform | 3.34 s | 2.50 s | 0.01 s | 0.34 s | 0.50 s |
| cell 300, transform with `F'` | 4.98 s | 3.35 s | 0.02 s | 0.67 s | 0.96 s |
| cell 1000, transform, 4 times the points | 3.81 s | 2.43 s | 0.01 s | 0.61 s | 0.77 s |
| 600 listed points at `2^18` by pairs | 2.32 s wall | | | | |

The loading is the device's load of each program, the imprint and the layout under a hundredth of a
second. A larger driver cache leaves it as it is, run after run. Cell 1000 at four times the points
takes 0.27 s more than cell 300 past the loading and the checks; a run's fixed cost is the loading,
two thirds of a cell's run with `F'`. The host's margin bound takes 0.15 s at `nu = 300` and 1.25 s
at `nu = 1000`, each call.

**What it repeats.**
- **Every program, loaded in every process.** The programs take `nu`, `2 nu + 1` and `2 nu^2` as
  parameters; one program serves every cell of a width. Each cell runs in its own process and each
  refine pass in another, and each loads every program again, 2.4 to 3.4 s a cell. One process running
  every cell and pass, each program loaded once, leaves the arithmetic.
- **The multiple evaluation, twice a cell.** `F` and `F'` share every pole position `pos_k`, and with
  it the leaves, the interaction lists, the near field's index and the twiddles; only the charges
  differ. The second evaluation runs the first's ten programs and walks the same tree again. One
  evaluation carrying both charge sets gives both.
- **The pole stage, twice.** The weighted poles take `ln k`, the root and three `cis` again; the first
  pole records times `-i ln k / 2^c` give them.
- **The general logarithm and roots at every point.** Across a cell `s = nu^2 (1 + e)`, `e < 3 / nu`:
  `ln s = 2 ln nu + 2 artanh(e / (2 + e))`, `x = nu (1 + e)^(1/2)` and `x^(-1/2) = nu^(-1/2) (1 + e)^(-1/4)`,
  each a series in the small `e` whose terms fall as `e` does, 5 to 10 terms at `nu = 300` for `2^-62`,
  with `ln nu`, `nu` and `nu^(-1/2)` the cell's constants. The point stage takes 33 folds and 21 terms
  for the first, and two Newton runs from folded seeds for the others.
- **The host's checks in line with the device.** Every sweep is checked on the host over its first 64
  lanes, or its first lane after the first sweep, before the device's next run: 0.34 to 0.67 s a run.
  The records those lanes read are all it needs, and the device need not wait on it.
- **The margin's bound, every call.** `max |M''''|` depends on `nu` alone, and the margin on `nu` and
  `p`; it is computed again for every run and every refine pass.
- **The coarse lattice's rate.** Four points a zero keeps the hidden pairs rare. With the margin, a
  pair hidden on a coarser lattice is found by the flag, and the margin grows as `h^4`: the rate is a
  cost to choose, the coarse points against the steps flagged.

**What it is not.** A change to any number the machine certifies. The terms are the same at every
point, and each repeat removed computes a value it already has.

**The field's tension (posit).** Posit, Doug's: the field is pulled on all its edges like a drum. The
tension damps its waves in general, and the whole field contracts to pay out slack for them.

In the field's terms:
- The tension is the pitch. Wave `k` runs at `theta' - ln k = ln(x / k)`, and `theta'' = 1 / (2 t)`
  raises every wave's pitch together as `t` climbs: the drum tightens, and the zeros crowd at a spacing
  of `2 pi / ln(t / (2 pi))`.
- The slack paid out is Turing's term. `N(t) = theta(t) / pi + 1 + S(t)`, and the integral of `S` over
  any span is held by `2.067 + 0.059 log t`: a zero early is paid back by one late, and no slack
  accumulates. The machine's proof stands on that term, `B` in its two windows.
- A new wave enters at the edge. At each cell's boundary the wave `k = nu` joins with amplitude
  `nu^(-1/2)`, carried in by the remainder `R`, the `C_0` term.
- The damping is across the waves, not in `t`. Each wave is weighted `k^(-1/2)` for good; `|Z|`'s peaks
  grow and the mean of `Z^2` grows as `log t`. The field's mean square is the harmonic sum of `1 / k`,
  which grows as `ln nu` while the waves grow as `nu`: each wave carries less as more join.

The term the machine holds and does not certify is the restoring force itself: how fast `S` returns to
0 across the zeros, its correlation from one zero to the next and over longer lags. It is measured
below, in "Measured, the field's tension", and the form factor of the certified zeros on `theta / pi`
asks the same measure.

**One process, each program loaded once.** `exact_zeta_turing serve` reads two lines a run, the input's
path and the output's, and answers each with `done` and the run's code. A program is imprinted, laid
out and loaded once for the process, under its steps, fields, members and outputs, which are all the
imprint and the layout read; every later stage whose program matches runs on the one loaded, and the
`programs` line gives the loads and the reuses. `exact_zeta_turing.py` sends every run to one such
process. Measured over the same cells:

| run | inside the binary | loading programs | the host's checks | programs loaded, reused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cell 300 at `2^15` with `F'`, the process's first | 2.76 s | 1.68 s | 0.69 s | 18, 10 |
| cells 301 to 305 at `2^15` with `F'` | 1.07 to 1.86 s | 0.001 to 0.002 s | 0.69 to 1.31 s | 0, 28 |
| cell 1000 at `2^17` with `F'`, after them | 3.68 s | 0.82 s | 1.52 s | 12, 16 |
| `refine` over cells 300 to 309 | 34 s wall, against 67 s a process a run | | | |

Within one cell, the evaluation of `F'` runs on the ten programs `F`'s loaded. Every program of cells
301 to 305 is cell 300's; cell 1000's widths differ in 12 of them. The `refine` run certifies the same
55,830 zeros at round 0 with no host check failed, and cell 301's output equals word for word the one
each run in its own process gives.

**The host's checks beside the device.** Of a check's 0.69 s, copying the members back takes 0.02 s:
the rest is the host's run of the lanes, one exact integer of 128 limbs a step, 1.2 ms a lane of the
6,663-step multipole shift and 2 ms for each one-lane check, its file of steps allocated each call.
Each check copies back only the records its lanes read, in runs of consecutive records, with the
index taken to their places in the copy, and runs on a host thread beside the device's next runs and
the other checks, at most half the cores at once. A lane's number is one of its program's inputs, and
a check's lanes run in one call from lane 0. Every check is settled before the output is written, and
each of the run's checks that reads a host flag is taken then. The pair-checked verdict's check reports
into the verdict's flag.

| run | inside the binary | loading programs | the host's checks, waited on | programs loaded, reused |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cell 300 at `2^15` with `F'`, the process's first | 3.11 s | 1.92 s | 0.20 s | 18, 10 |
| cells 301 to 305 at `2^15` with `F'` | 0.58 to 0.64 s | 0.001 to 0.002 s | 0.19 to 0.22 s | 0, 28 |
| cell 1000 at `2^17` with `F'`, after them | 1.58 s | 0.53 s | 0.35 s | 12, 16 |
| `refine` over cells 300 to 309 | 28 s wall | | | |

The `refine` run certifies the same 55,830 zeros with no host check failed, `pairs` over cells 40 to 46
gives its 3,283 zeros, and cell 301's output equals word for word the one each run in its own process
gives. A cell of `2^15` points runs in 0.6 s inside the binary, against 4.98 s a process; the
`refine` run's wall past the cells is the host's margin bound and the listed points' runs.

**The listed points' check, and the margin's bound once a `nu`.** Profiled, the `refine` run waits
22.8 s on the device of its 27 s: 11.9 s of it the ten listed-point runs, 1.1 s each whatever their
points, their pair stage's host check of 64 points' `nu` terms, 19,200 lanes at `nu = 300`, run in one
call. Its lanes read their own numbers: a pair finds its `k` and its point from its lane's. The host's run
in `cycle.c` takes `first`, the lane it starts at: it runs lanes `first` to `first + count - 1`, each
with its own number and its own members, and writes their records from the start of `out`; a request
that does not set it starts at 0. Every check runs in parts of 8 lanes or more on as many threads as
half the cores, the pair check with them, beside the device.

`max |M''''|` over a cell depends on `nu` alone. Its sum over `n <= nu` takes each term rounded up to a
whole number of `2^-100`, which keeps it a bound and its sum an integer's, and is kept for each `nu`:
the margin, `h / 3` and the steepness come out the same to the unit at cells 300 and 1000 by both
methods, the bound in 0.20 s at `nu = 1000` once and 0.01 s after, against 1.40 s each call.

| run | wall or inside | before |
|---|---|---|
| 600 listed points at `2^18` by pairs, cell 300 | 0.23 s wall | 1.15 s |
| cell 301 at `2^15` with `F'` | 0.46 s inside, 0.09 s of it the checks | 0.58 s |
| `refine` over cells 300 to 309 | 14 s wall | 28 s |
| `pairs` over cells 40 to 46 | 1 s wall | 3 s |

The `refine` run certifies the same 55,830 zeros with every cell's spans, listed points and zeros found
the same and no host check failed, `pairs` its 3,283, and cell 301's output equals word for word the
one each run in its own process gives.

**`F` and `F'` as two sets of one evaluation.** Timed run by run over cell 301, the device's 148 runs of
the two evaluations take 0.29 s, and the local shift 0.205 s of it: 18 runs of its 18,124-step program
at 11 ms each, whether a level holds 8 boxes or 2,048. A lane's steps run one after another, and the
run's time is its lanes' length, not their count. The poles and the weighted poles stand at the same
places and lay their records out alike, and every program of `F'`'s evaluation is `F`'s. The two run as
two sets of one evaluation: the weighted poles' records after the poles', each stage's records set
after set with one zero record after them all, every index of the second set moved by the first set's
count, and one run a stage over both. The near field's lanes find their points from their own numbers,
and it runs once a set; the local shift's and the evaluation's lanes take theirs within the box and the
point. Each run checks the first lanes of each set. With the poles in both sets, every stage's two
halves come out equal word for word.

|---|---|---|---|
| cell 300 at `2^15` with `F'`, the process's first | 2.40 s | 0.14 s | 18, 0 |
| cells 301 to 305 at `2^15` with `F'` | 0.33 to 0.39 s | 0.12 to 0.14 s | 0, 18 |
| cell 1000 at `2^17` with `F'`, after them | 1.28 s | 0.17 s | 12, 6 |

`refine` over cells 300 to 309, `pairs` over cells 40 to 46, `transform` over cells 300 to 305 and
`both` over cells 40 to 44 each give output equal to the two evaluations' build, cell 301's equal word
for word with every point's `F'`. `refine` over cells 300 to 309 takes 15 s: past the cells, its wall
is the host's work between the device's runs.

**Measured, the field's tension.** `exact_zeta_tension.py` runs each cell once on the device with every
point listed, on the lattice two steps finer than four points a zero, and places each zero between two
`F`'s at a change of sign of the device's `Z`, on the line through `Z` at the two points. A close pair
no point falls between is found where `|Z|` dips and keeps its sign, listed again 64 times finer by
pairs. N is held by Turing's method at cells 300 and 310; at cells 1000 and 1003 it is given from a run
of the machine over cells 999 to 1003, which closes in 2 rounds. On `u = theta / pi + 1`, `S` between
the `n`-th zero and the next is `n - u` at their midpoint. The statistics are the host's, in floating
point, over the device's `Z`.

| measured | cells 300 to 310 | cells 1000 to 1003 |
|---|---|---|
| zeros placed, of N's difference | 69,789 of 69,789, 6 in 3 dips | 83,036 of 83,036, 6 in 3 dips |
| `ln(t / 2 pi)`, the mean spacing in `t` | 11.441, 0.5492 | 13.819, 0.4547 |
| `S`'s mean, its variance, Selberg's leading term | 0.0000, 0.0701, 0.1235 | 0.0000, 0.0788, 0.1330 |
| the spacings' variance, neighbors' correlation | 0.1676, -0.349 | 0.1701, -0.343 |
| `S`'s pull back each zero, the spacings shuffled | -0.389, -0.0001 | -0.354, 0.0000 |
| `S`'s least correlation, at `k` zeros and in `t` | -0.625 at `k = 26`, 14.28 | -0.611 at `k = 31`, 14.10 |
| the prime powers to 100: signs the same, rms, scale | 58 of 60, 0.043, 1.220 | 57 of 60, 0.031, 1.118 |
| the prime powers to 10,000: signs the same, rms | 59 of 60, 0.060 | 57 of 60, 0.048 |
| `S`'s correlation over 100, 1,000 zeros | +0.352, -0.112 | +0.467, -0.146 |

- **The restoring force is in the spacings.** Each step of `S` takes back 0.39 of `S` at cell 300 and
  0.35 at cell 1000. With the same spacings shuffled, every gap kept and their order dropped, it takes
  back none. A wide gap is followed by a narrow one, neighbors' correlation -0.35.
- **The slack grows as Selberg's term.** `S`'s variance rises by 0.0087 from the first height to the
  second, and Selberg's leading term `(1 / (2 pi^2)) ln ln(t / 2 pi)` by 0.0095. The term itself stands
  0.054 above at both, the constant it leaves out.
- **The waves of `S` are the prime powers.** `S = -(1 / pi)` times the sum over `p^r` of
  `sin(r t ln p) / (r p^(r / 2))`. With the phases independent, its correlation at a lag `tau` in `t` is
  the sum of `cos(r tau ln p) / (r^2 p^r)` over the sum of `1 / (r^2 p^r)`. Over lags of 1 to 60 zeros the
  prime powers to 100 give the sign of `S`'s correlation at 58 and 57 of them.
- **The deepest trough stands at a lag in `t`, not in zeros.** It falls at 14.28 and 14.10 in `t`, 26 and
  31 zeros: 26 times the ratio of the spacings, 1.208, gives 31.4. The trough of 2 alone, half the beat
  `ln(t / 2 pi) / ln 2`, would fall at 8.3 and 10.0 zeros; the first trough falls at 6 and 7. The small
  primes together set it, and 2 alone does not.
- **The number variance saturates.** Over windows of `L` on `u`:

| `L` | 1 | 5 | 8 | 20 | 100 | 400 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| the zeros, cells 300 to 310 | 0.333 | 0.436 | 0.429 | 0.357 | 0.335 | 0.404 |
| the zeros, cells 1000 to 1003 | 0.329 | 0.443 | 0.457 | 0.390 | 0.332 | 0.378 |
| the spacings shuffled, cells 1000 to 1003 | 0.337 | 1.020 | 1.544 | 3.583 | 18.29 | 76.04 |
| GUE's `(1 / pi^2)(ln 2 pi L + gamma + 1 - pi^2 / 8)` | 0.221 | 0.384 | 0.432 | 0.525 | 0.688 | 0.828 |

  The zeros' variance stands near GUE's to `L` about 10, rises no further past 0.46, and stays between
  0.32 and 0.49 out to `L = 400`, where GUE's reaches 0.83. The shuffled spacings' grows as `L`. Every
  gap's spread is the same in both, and the field holds the count only through how each gap holds to
  the others.

## The zeros in the engine's field

Doug's. Posit.
1. If this holds, the two crystals describe how to finish it: the problem is suspended inside the
   engine's own anisotropic field, which the engine controls completely.
2. Placing the zeros in that field establishes their existence.
3. Two such problems can be combined, one saturated and the other desaturated.
4. Everything is held as differences.
5. A third pair of crystals can be added for time, to drag the clock. The problem space is
   n·n^(n^n), and it is not to be bounded.
6. e gives a period that is known without computing it, but its magnitude changes as a function of the
   period and its neighbors, which is not wanted here. The carrier wanted has a guaranteed
   period and a guaranteed change of magnitude, such as the continued fraction {1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2}, in
   the same spirit as e: its period is guaranteed, and its neighbors absorb the peaks. The sequence
   1, 1, 2 is known entirely, and the mortar between its terms still qualifies the peaks. It works as a
   carrier signal and lets the moments be measured, the inertia and the angle among them. A known
   signal adds coherence, as in signal theory. {1,1,1} and {1,1,2} will be in resonance. {1,1,1} gives the
   Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio (1 + √5)/2, and the family goes on with {2,2,2}, then
   {2,2,3}, {3,3,3} and further.
7. Two crystals can be put in resonance with known harmonics and to oppose them. They can be
   integrated and recombined in any way, to lock onto any harmonic chosen.
8. Once e is replaced by the guaranteed carrier, the Taylor series are no longer infinite processes,
   and the fog of Cantor's completed infinity does not apply. The sharp distinction: the engine does
   not hold all of infinity. It holds all of the unbounded variability in the locale it examines.
9. The primes are the guarantee dead reckoning runs on: they make the same kind of noise everywhere.
   Between two primes the line is unboundedly variable, with any number of curves, switchbacks, rises
   and falls, compressions and expansions. This is the premise of the rail.

What the math bounds of each. Derived unless marked.
- **(1) The places.** The two crystals of [two_crystals.md](../engine/two_crystals.md) are two
  completions of `Q`, `R` by the top projection and `Z_2` by the wrap, and the adeles join every
  completion. Zeta has one factor at each place (Tate 1950, cited there).
  - The finite places give the Euler product, the product over `p` of `(1 - p^(-s))^(-1)`.
  - The real place gives `pi^(-s/2) Gamma(s/2)`. On the line its phase is `theta(t)`, and
    `Z(t) = exp(i theta(t)) zeta(1/2 + i t)`.
  - The carrier `exp(i theta)` of entry 16 is the real place's phase. The main sum `F` over `n <= nu` is
    the finite places' share at that height.
  - Connes (1999) places the zeros in the adele class space as an absorption spectrum, and RH there is
    a positivity in a trace formula. Bost and Connes (1995) build a system whose partition function is
    `zeta(beta)`, with a phase transition at `beta = 1`. Both are reported and not read here.
- **(2) Existence.** Two certified points of opposite sign hold a zero on the line between them: the
  intermediate value theorem on a real `Z`, read with no evaluation at the zero.
  - A sign is a COMPARE. A COMPARE does not factor through the wrap, and through the top projection it is
    never reversed, with a tie possible. The bound on `Z` rules the tie out.
  - Turing's count closes over a range only when every zero in it is on the line and simple.
  - An off-line pair of zeros below a height shows at a finite stage: the cell that holds it falls
    short by 2 on every lattice. A close pair on the line closes on a lattice fine enough.
  - "None anywhere" is not reached at a finite stage. The machine's "every halt is seen at a finite
    stage, and only "never" needs the ω stage" ([two_crystals.md](../engine/two_crystals.md), "The
    ordered machine") has the same shape.
- **(3) Saturated and desaturated.** Read as the two sides of the pair correlation's form factor `K`.
  - Below the Heisenberg time, `tau < 1`, `K` is the ramp, carried by the primes. Montgomery (1973)
    proves `K(tau) = |tau|` there, assuming RH.
  - Past it, `K` is conjectured to stand at 1, the plateau, where the zeros are read one by one.
  - Bogomolny and Keating derive the plateau from the primes' correlations through the functional
    equation, assuming Hardy and Littlewood's conjecture. Berry and Keating read it as resurgence. Each
    is reported and not read here.
  - In entry 16's terms, `F` is the ramp's side and the certified zeros the plateau's. `Z = 2 Re w + R`
    folds `F` onto its mirror by the functional equation.
- **(4) Deltas.** Every count above reads a difference.
  - The certificate is the difference of two signs.
  - Turing's method is `N(t)` less the sign changes.
  - The map is a miss less the steady arc.
  - The form factor reads only the pairs' differences `gamma_j - gamma_k`. The primes enter `|F|^2` as
    `ln(m / n)`.
- **(5) The clocks.** `N(t)`, the count, steps by one at each zero. `theta(t) / pi + 1` turns at the mean
  rate. Their difference is `S(t)`: `N(t) = theta(t) / pi + 1 + S(t)`.
  - Turing's method is a bound on the integral of `S`.
  - Selberg's central limit theorem spreads `S(t)` as `sqrt((1/2) log log t)`, reported and not read here.
  - On the clock `theta / pi` the mean spacing is 1 at every height. The form factor is defined there.
  - The widths come from the input (entry 15), and a height is a field of the record.
- **(6) The known carrier in place of e.** Each continued fraction's floors grow by its partial quotients,
  as in "The golden helix" of [two_crystals.md](../engine/two_crystals.md).
  - `e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, ...]`. Its period is 3, and the third quotient of each period
    is `2k`, growing with `k`. The growth a period rises with its place: "the magnitude changes as a
    function of the period".
  - `x = [1; 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, ...]` repeats `1, 1, 2` without end. `x = (5x + 2) / (3x + 1)`, and
    `x = (2 + sqrt(10)) / 3`, a quadratic irrational; a continued fraction is periodic exactly when its
    value is one (Lagrange).
  - A period of `1, 1, 2` is the matrix `[[1, 1], [1, 0]]^2 [[2, 1], [1, 0]] = [[5, 2], [3, 1]]`, trace
    6 and determinant -1. Its convergents grow by `3 + sqrt(10)`, about 6.162, each period: the same
    growth at every period, known before any is read.
  - Read as a carrier, the sequence is known to every place, and a measurement against it is a
    correlation with a known reference, the lock-in of signal theory. Coherent sums over `n` periods
    grow as `n`, and the parts not locked to the reference grow as `sqrt(n)`.
  - Prior art, reported from a web search and not read here.
    - Gram's points are a known carrier in `theta / pi`, step 1 (entry 5).
    - Landau (1911), made uniform by Gonek: the sum of `x^(i gamma)` over the zeros up to `T` is
      `-(T / 2 pi) Lambda(x) / sqrt(x)` plus a smaller error. It is of order `T` when `x` is a prime
      power and small otherwise: the zeros locked to a known oscillation. Odlyzko's Fourier transform of
      the zeros shows the same peaks at the logarithms of prime powers.
    - Ford and Zaharescu, then with Soundararajan: for a fixed `alpha`, `{alpha gamma}` is uniformly
      distributed mod 1, and its departures tie to the pair correlation and to primes in short
      intervals. Ford, Meng and Zaharescu read `alpha_1 gamma, ..., alpha_n gamma` at once.
    - Dyson, "Birds and frogs" (Notices of the AMS, 2009): if RH holds, the zeros are a one-dimensional
      quasicrystal whose Fourier transform sits on the logarithms of prime powers, and a classification
      of one-dimensional quasicrystals might reach them.
    - A Sturmian sequence of quadratic irrational slope is fixed by a substitution, a known
      one-dimensional quasicrystal (Crisp, Moran, Pollington and Shiue, 1993, cited from knowledge and
      not from the search).
    - Each correlates the zeros, once found, with a known reference. A known sequence placed in the
      lattice `Z` is read on is not among them.
  - **The metallic companions** (posit 6, later terms). `1, 1, 1, ...` is the golden ratio
    `phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2`, a root of `x^2 - x - 1`, whose convergent denominators are the Fibonacci
    numbers. `2, 2, 2, ...` is the silver ratio `1 + sqrt(2)`, a root of `x^2 - 2 x - 1`, whose
    convergents are the Pell numbers. Both are metallic means, `x^2 = n x + 1` at `n = 1` and `n = 2`,
    and both are Pisot units. `phi` is the worst-approximable number (Hurwitz, the `sqrt(5)` bound): a
    carrier stepped by it spreads the most evenly of any quadratic irrational, the flattest reference.
    `1, 1, 2` is golden on each run of two 1s and departs on the 2, a period-3 kick; overlaid on `phi`
    the two agree on the 1, 1 and beat at the 2. Prior art and the Pisot and diffraction facts are in
    [zeta_prior_art.md](zeta_prior_art.md).
  - **The family, and why every member qualifies** (posit 6, later terms, `{2,2,3}`, `{3,3,3}`, and
    on). `3, 3, 3, ...` is the bronze ratio `(3 + sqrt(13)) / 2` (`n = 3`), and `2, 2, 3` is the
    period-3 comb with matrix `[[2,1],[1,0]]^2 [[3,1],[1,0]] = [[17,5],[7,2]]`, trace 19, growth
    `(19 + sqrt(365)) / 2`. Derived, elementary: a purely periodic continued fraction of period `k` has
    matrix the product of `k` copies of `[[a_i,1],[1,0]]`, determinant `(-1)^k`. A 2 by 2 matrix's
    eigenvalues multiply to its determinant: the growth constant `lambda > 1` pairs with a conjugate
    of size `1 / lambda < 1`, every periodic comb's growth is a quadratic Pisot unit, and every member
    is a one-dimensional Pisot quasicrystal with pure-point diffraction. The `{n,n,n}` diagonal are the
    metallic means, sweeping from the densest and flattest (golden) to sparser as `n` grows; the kicked
    combs interleave them. Which member locks best to the zeros is measured, not chosen.
  - **Synthesis** (posit 7: integrate and recombine the carriers in any way to lock onto any
    harmonic chosen). A finite sum of pure-point combs is pure point: a combination of these
    members is a carrier with lines at a chosen set of frequencies, a matched filter built to a target.
    The target the explicit formula names is the prime-power comb at `(log p^m) / 2 pi` (Landau and
    Gonek, [zeta_prior_art.md](zeta_prior_art.md)). The caveat: the members' lines sit at algebraic
    frequencies, and `log p` is transcendental (Lindemann). A line lands on a prime power only to a
    precision, at a finite height the window's width, the engine's own discipline. In the
    engine a carrier is one weight field a lane, and a combination is another weight field: synthesis
    costs one field, not a rebuild.
  - Wanted, not built: lattices in `theta / pi` stepped by these combs, the moments of `w` (inertia,
    angle, angular momentum `Im(conj(F) F')`) read against each, their beat read as the difference, and
    each read with the steps shuffled, as the null.
- **(7) Two crystals tuned to a known comb and set against each other.** Read against the engine's two
  crystals and the explicit formula.
  - `Z = 2 Re w + R` is two counter-rotating combs, `w = exp(i theta) F` and its conjugate, one added
    and one taken off (Berry's Riemann-Siegel remainder, [zeta_prior_art.md](zeta_prior_art.md)). A
    zero is their exact destructive interference, a null. The critical line is the Stokes line of that
    expansion.
  - As a pairing: a test function on the zeros against its transform on the primes, with a sign, is the
    Weil explicit formula, and the sign holding one way is Weil's positivity, equivalent to RH
    (Connes). The zeros read as an absorption spectrum, a dip, the engine's sign change.
  - As quasicrystals: the prime comb and its Fourier dual are self-dual, and a zero off the line would
    make one peak grow while self-duality forbids it (Dyson's program; a claimed proof by Shaughnessy,
    unrefereed, in [zeta_prior_art.md](zeta_prior_art.md)).
  - What the engine adds: it holds both combs in one field and reads a chosen carrier against them
    exactly, with a drawn null. What it cannot reach is the all-functions positivity, the hypothesis
    itself.
- **(8) The carrier is finite-state, not a truncated series.** Read against the two crystals'
  computability.
  - **The sharp distinction: completeness is local.** The machine never holds the completed infinite
    totality, the fog. In a locale it holds every bit of variability the locale contains, exactly: an
    output's `w` bits read the input to `w + 3L` bits, a bounded cone, and the local fiber is held
    whole ([two_crystals.md](../engine/two_crystals.md), "The bits one level reads", "Counting
    quanta"). Posit 8: the engine holds all of the unbounded variability in the locale
    it examines, and never all of infinity. The carrier, the widths from the input, and the certified count
    over a height range are each this shape: the locale's full variability held exactly, the global
    totality never.
  - `e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, ...]` has partial quotients that grow without bound: no
    finite-state law gives its continued fraction, and a value for `e` comes from a series truncated
    with a bound. A quadratic irrational has an eventually periodic continued fraction (Lagrange), a
    cycle: `1, 1, 2` and `2, 2, 2` are a finite automaton emitting integers, and their convergents come
    from an integer recurrence (Fibonacci, Pell). The carrier is stepped as an integer pattern, with no
    series and no truncation; every window is exact in the engine's integer arithmetic.
  - The distinction is finite-state, not finite-precision. The engine still truncates `exp`, `cos` and
    `ln` with a certified bound (Z1, Z2). The carrier needs none of them.
  - Cantor's fog is the uncountable continuum of reals with no finite description: in
    [two_crystals.md](../engine/two_crystals.md), Haar-almost every element of `Z_2` is Martin-Lof
    random, measure 1, incompressible. The metallic carriers are the other corner: countable, measure
    zero, finite-state. The reference carries no truncation error of its own.
  - The boundary, honest: the fog is not lifted off the zeros. Their ordinates are not known to be
    algebraic, and "every zero" is the uncountable statement. What the exact carrier buys is that every
    remaining uncertainty sits on the measured side and the window, never the ruler, which sharpens the
    drawn null: a structure the shuffle does not account for is the zeros', not the reference's.
- **(9) The primes are the reckoning, and the variability lives between them.** The premise.
  - **What is fixed.** `F'/F` carries `-Lambda(n) n^(-1/2)` at the frequency `ln n` for every `n` to
    `N`, the same weight at every height; only the phase `t ln n` moves, and it is known ahead. The
    weights are proved, by the sieve and by Proth's witness, never fitted. Each prime is a rotor of its
    own, and the noise is always of one kind, Bohr's picture of `zeta` as a product over independent
    rotations, one a prime (from knowledge).
  - **What varies, globally without bound.** The `ln p` are linearly independent over `Q`, which is
    unique factorization, and by Kronecker every set of phases `t ln p` comes round again as near as
    asked: every shape the lines make, curve, switchback, swell, compression, they make somewhere. As
    `t` grows `N` grows and primes join. In the strip `1/2 < sigma < 1` Voronin's universality makes it
    every non-vanishing analytic shape on a disc; on the line Selberg's law spreads `log |zeta|` as a
    Gaussian of variance `(1/2) log log t`, unbounded and slow (both from knowledge, not read).
  - **What varies, locally bounded.** At a height `F` is a finite sum, its frequencies to `ln N`, and
    its sources come at about `ln N / 2 pi` a unit of `t`. On any stretch the switchbacks and swells
    are finite, and the device holds them all: the locale's whole variability, never the totality, as
    in (8).
  - **The reckoning.** The prime lines forecast the twist, `phi' ~ theta' - sum of Lambda(n) n^(-1/2)
    sin(t ln n)`, cheap and fixed, and mark the steps at risk (entry 16, the seiches). On the line the
    series does not converge, and at a source `F'/F` has a pole no finite set of lines makes: the lines
    guarantee the kind of noise, not each pulse. The fix at each coarse point, `F'/F` exact on the
    device, holds what lies between the lines.
  - **The primes read back from the zeros** (entry 16): the certified zeros of `Z` in one window place
    every prime power past the window's `N`, by Landau.

What is not derived. "Anisotropic field" and "bring this home" have no definition here to derive from.
Every structure the field shows is ranked against a drawn null through the same field: GUE draws in
place of the zeros, or the carrier's phase shuffled. A rate past `1 / (d + 1)` over `d` draws reads as
the zeros' own, as the crystal's identity is read in [two_crystals.md](../engine/two_crystals.md).

## The problem, stated fully

Written here so it sits in one place a later entry can find, and not adopted as a target. The Riemann zeta function is
`zeta(s) = sum_{n>=1} n^{-s}` for `Re(s) > 1`, continued analytically to the whole complex plane apart
from a simple pole at `s = 1`. Its trivial zeros are the negative even integers. Its non-trivial zeros
lie in the critical strip `0 < Re(s) < 1`. The Riemann hypothesis is that every non-trivial zero has
real part exactly `1/2`, the critical line. This workbook writes the statement down and does nothing
with it.

## The bounding function for zeta

Placing zeta in the boundary table of the precision document, section 10:

- The values at the even integers are DEFINED: `zeta(2k) = c_k pi^{2k}`, an exact rational times an
  exact transcendental. Their boundary is a FORMAT boundary, the precision scale, raisable without
  limit; there is no measurement floor and no completeness floor on a value.
- The values at the odd integers, Apery's `zeta(3)` and up, are also defined, computed by a convergent
  series to any precision, the same format boundary. No closed form in `pi` is known for them, a fact
  about the FORM and not a boundary on the precision.
- The ZEROS carry a COMPLETENESS boundary. A computation names finitely many, to a stated precision, at
  a horizon: Titchmarsh named 1041, Turing extended the method, Odlyzko reached 20 billion near the
  `10^23`-rd, Gourdon the first `10^13`. None of those is all of them, and no precision closes the gap;
  only more computation moves the horizon, and the horizon never reaches a statement about every zero.
  That is the completeness boundary of section 6, on its most famous instance.

Zeta sits in two regimes at once, like particle physics: its values are defined and unbounded in
precision, and its zeros carry the completeness boundary the hypothesis lives behind.

## Constructors, and what inherits their proof

The exact quantities are built by a fixed set of constructors: the exact integer and rational
operations, the identity hyperedges, and the convergent exact series for the transcendentals, `pi` by
Machin and by Euler, a logarithm by artanh, a root by the integer square root.
`evidence/proofs/posits/proof_precision_theorems.py` proves those constructors sound: scale invariance,
the no-alias convolution, CRT bijectivity, the Fermat inverse, exact accumulation.
`proof_set_theory.py` proves the generation operator over them is a Moore closure.

A quantity built only from proven constructors inherits their proof. `zeta(2k) = c_k pi^{2k}` is a
rational from the Bernoulli recurrence times a power of `pi` from a proven series, combined by proven
exact multiplication. Its exactness is not a new thing to prove; it is the constructors' exactness
carried through. The convolution identity is then a check that the carried value is the intended one, a
second route in the sense Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld gave result checking: a simpler independent
computation that catches a faulty one without trusting it. What is never inherited is a statement about
the zeros, because no constructor produces one.

## Prior art, two threads

- Result checking by agreement. That a value is trusted only when a second, independent route confirms
  it is program result checking and self-testing/correcting: Blum and Kannan; Blum, Luby and Rubinfeld,
  "Self-Testing/Correcting with Applications to Numerical Problems", JCSS 1993. The engine's discipline,
  two routes or it does not ship, is that idea. Reported from a web search, the papers unread here, and
  the file stands on the reproduction.
- The computational path on zeta. Others walked it without exact arithmetic. Riemann's unpublished
  formula, recovered by Siegel in 1932; Titchmarsh's 1930s machine computation of 1041 zeros; Turing in
  1953, whose method reads the real-valued function on the critical line (Odlyzko, "Alan Turing and the
  Riemann Zeta Function"); the Odlyzko-Schonhage algorithm and Odlyzko's 20 billion zeros near the
  `10^23`-rd; Gourdon's `10^13`. They used floating point, high-precision floating point and interval
  arithmetic, and they computed the ZEROS this workbook has not touched. Exact arithmetic adds no
  rounding and a second route on the VALUES; it does not yet reach where their work is. Reported from a
  web search, papers unread.

## The precision-as-obstacle tradition, and where exact arithmetic sits

A whole line of work reached for verified arithmetic because floating point could not carry a proof.
The statement is standard: floating point is subject to rounding and is not suitable for a numerically
verified proof. Verified computing uses interval arithmetic, carrying each quantity as an interval
guaranteed to contain the true value, with directed rounding at each step. On zeta, David Platt isolated
every non-trivial zero with imaginary part below about `3 * 10^10` to an absolute precision of `2^-102`,
and verified the list complete with a provably correct version of Turing's method, at a cost in multi-precision
certified numerics far above hardware floating point. That is an independent verification of the
hypothesis up to that height, and it was possible only by leaving floating point behind.

Where exact arithmetic sits in that tradition is worth stating exactly, because it is easy to overstate.
Exact arithmetic is the limit of the interval: a zero-width interval, the value carried with no rounding
at all, when the value is exactly nameable. The zeta VALUES at the even integers are built by the constructors. A non-trivial ZERO is not: no
closed form in them is known. It does have a finite description, the `n`-th zero above the real
axis, and a bracket around it narrows as far as asked. It is a computable real, in the countable
set of entry 2. Whether its imaginary part is irrational, algebraic or transcendental is not known.
No arithmetic, exact included, carries it at zero width. The most any computation does with a zero is bracket it, and
Platt's `2^-102` interval is that bracket done rigorously. Exact arithmetic does not supersede that
work; it sharpens the value side to zero width and leaves the zero side to the same verified enclosure
the field already uses. Reported from a web search, the papers unread here.

This is the honest reason the earlier entries touch the values and not the zeros: the values are built by
the constructors exact arithmetic carries, and the zeros are reached only through a bracket.

## Where they are bound, and what is wanted in their place

The same table the Navier-Stokes workbook keeps, for the zeros. The wants are a
sounding board's reading of the point-cloud approach onto zeta, stated plainly. The test is what would answer each
want, and the status says what has been run. No row bears on the hypothesis.

| where it is bound | as the problem states it | wanted | what would test it | status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| the critical strip | `0 < Re(s) < 1`, the non-trivial zeros inside it | normalize to the interval [0, 1] | nothing: the strip's real part already runs from 0 to 1, and the critical line is its midpoint | holds by the definition of the strip |
| the critical line, `Re(s) = 1/2` | the hypothesis puts every non-trivial zero on it | the field's exact symmetry boundary, acting as a membrane or a solid wall does in the fluid model | the fixed set of `s -> 1 - conj(s)` | proven, exactly (entry 3): the line is that fixed set. That the zeros sit on it is the hypothesis, open |
| the symmetry, and the `1,1 -> 2` table | `zeta(conj s) = conj zeta(s)` from the real coefficients, and the functional equation | how the `1,1 -> 2` truth table represents the conjugate symmetry that holds the zeros on the line | the Klein four-group of entry 3: it takes a zero to an orbit of four, which collapses to a conjugate pair on the line. An orbit of four off the line is allowed by the group. The symmetry alone does not force a zero onto the line. The table is the sum of two bits, and no step from it to the group is written | the group is proven (entry 3); the forcing is the hypothesis, open; the table-to-group step is wanted, not written |
| a zero | a point where `zeta(s) = 0` in the strip, with no known closed form | the exact point where the field's magnitude is `0` | the winding of zeta around a box symmetric about the line, read from the signs of `Re zeta`, `Im zeta` and `|Re zeta| - |Im zeta|`; and the real-valued function on the critical line Turing's method reads, where a sign change brackets a zero | the winding: run (entry 4), forty zeros, each placed by sixteen bits. The sign of `Z(t)` is read at the Gram points (entry 5), and certified on the device, a certified sign change bracketing a zero (entries 9, 14 and 15). A zero has no known closed form in the constructors, and the most any computation does with one is bracket it (the precision tradition section) |
| the digits of a zero | Riemann-Siegel or Euler-Maclaurin, to a stated precision | exact values, with no infinite digit strings and no spurious divergences | Platt's interval computation, which isolated every zero below about `3 * 10^10` to `2^-102`, with directed rounding at each step | done by the field, rigorously, and reported from a web search (the precision tradition section). Exact arithmetic sharpens the values to zero width and leaves the zeros to the same enclosure |
| the zeros as a set | counted by `N(T) ~ (T / 2pi) log(T / 2pi) - T / 2pi` | an infinite point cloud in which every branch has an answer | every zero up to a height `T` found by the winding count, and the count checked against `N(T)`; and the same count checked against `N(T)` by Turing's method | the winding count: run below `t = 123` (entry 4), forty, as the published table has them. Turing's method: run (entries 9, 14 and 15), every zero in `(0, 6295757.960979]` a certified sign change, 12,843,158. A count reaches a horizon and never all of them (the bounding function section) |
| the spacing law | Montgomery's pair correlation against the GUE | the spacing matches the energy levels of quantum chaotic systems, said to be proven | a proof of Montgomery's conjecture | not proven: entry 3 records it as a conjecture with strong numerical support, in the column labeled a dream |
| L* on zeta | not in the problem | zeta treated as unknown hardware, and the field's preferences probed the way a processor's timing is | L* learns a finite automaton from membership and equivalence queries. Zeta would need an alphabet and a membership query, and neither is named | wanted, not built. engine_table has no L* row; its M23 holds the refinement loop, not built |
| every zero on the line | the hypothesis | the structure forces every zero onto that symmetry line | a proof | open. Nothing here bears on it |

## The device program, and what it wants

Entries 4 to 6 run on the host, in Python, one value at a time, apart from Z3's coefficient `C`,
which entry 6's triangle sweeps on the device. Every point in a pass is independent of every other,
and a pass is one sweep: each part below is a sweep over lanes, each reads the records the last
pass wrote, and each writes verdict fields the next one reads. A program is a list of record steps;
keymath imprints it, the scheduler lays it out, the record compiler emits it for the device, and it
runs as a tessera job ([prg_sch/README.md](../../../src/c/engine/prg_sch/README.md)). The same
program on the host, from the exact integer library, is its port check. The rows use the engine table's columns, and the M numbers are its
parts ([engine_table.md](../engine/engine_table.md)). No scale is written into the program: the
places, `N` and the widths come from the records.

| part | the algebra it holds to | does | wants | tried, and what it gave | status | next |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Z1. The constants** | `ln n = k ln 2 + 2 artanh((n - 2^k) / (n + 2^k))` and `ln n = j ln 3 + 2 artanh((n - 3^j) / (n + 3^j))`, each a floor at its scale, and the two agreeing through `naturals._agree`. pi by Machin and Euler the same way. Each constant is held as its real and its operator: the floor at its places and the series that gives the next place. Across a cell, `ln(x / m) = ln(nu / m) + A` for every `m`, with `x = nu + l / 2^b` and `A = 2 artanh(l / D)`, `D = nu 2^(b+1) + l`: one series a lane, and `ln(nu / m)` the cell's constant. The first `L` terms of `A` are `2 l S / (Lambda D^(2L - 1))`, `Lambda` the least common multiple of the odd numbers below `2L` and `S` an integer by Horner's rule in `l^2`; every term is positive and below `(l / D)^2` times the one before it, and the tail is below `2 l^(2L + 1) / ((2L + 1) D^(2L - 1) (D^2 - l^2))`. | `ln n` on the host, in `representation.constants.naturals`, each `(n, digits)` asked once. `A` on the device, in `exact_zeta_lobes.cu`'s log stage, one lane a point of the cell: each lane holds `l S`, `D^(2L - 1)`, `l^(2L + 1)` and `D^2 - l^2`, four integers that bracket `A` exactly, the constants `Lambda / (2k + 1)` read from the record. | `ln n` and pi as record programs (M10) at the places the record carries, each with its second route and their agreement written as a field. The device has pi as `pi_tower` (M19), bracketed by Machin, and `A` across a cell, bracketed by its tail. A deeper pass extends a constant's series from the terms it holds. | The run to `t = 123` asks `ln n` for every `n` up to 128 at up to 36 digits, and both routes agree on every one: exit 0. On the device at `nu = 2`, `b = 9`, 513 lanes: the host's run of the log stage equals the device's word for word over 64 lanes, and the house `ln` lies inside the bracket at every lane checked. At `L = 48` the stage is 295 steps, the bracket `10^-69.5` wide at the cell's far end, where `l / D = 1/5`, and `10^-323` at its first lane; at `L = 56` the registers pass the file's 256 limbs and the layout refuses. The field `nu 2^b` is read at `nu`'s own bits, and every power of `D` is as wide as that field. | `ln n` host only; `A` built and run | `ln(nu / m)` for every `m` up to `nu` as a device stage; a reference point nearer each lane, its own `A` from the same stage, to make `l / D` smaller than the register file's 48 terms allow |
| **Z2. The powers** | `n^-s = exp(-sigma ln n) (cos(t ln n) - i sin(t ln n))`, and its derivative `-ln n n^-s`. exp by `x = r - k ln 2` with `0 < r <= ln 2`, a Taylor series in `r`, then a shift by `k` either way. cos and sin by taking whole turns of `2 pi` off, then one series. Every term is a floor at places plus `GUARD`, twenty digits. | On the host, one `(point, n)` at a time. | One lane per `(point, n)`, `n` from 1 to `2N`, the point and its places read from its record. A series runs while its term is nonzero: a lane whose term reads zero adds zero, and the sweep ends where the sum of every lane's term field is zero. The record machine's operations carry it (M10: product, sum, difference, absolute, compare, and the divisions). | On the host every power at sixteen places plus the guard is 120 bits, which four 32-bit limbs hold, 128 bits. The exact limb arithmetic is a power-of-two count of 32-bit limbs, and its width doubles with no ceiling (`exact_integer_widths.h`). | not built | exp, cos and sin as record programs over one sweep of lanes |
| **Z3. The sum and its tail** | Euler-Maclaurin cut at `N`: the head, the sum of `n^-s` for `n < N`, then `C N^-s`, with `C = N / (s - 1) + 1/2 + sum over k from 1 to N of B_2k / (2k)! s(s+1)...(s+2k-2) N^(1-2k)`, an exact complex rational. `C'` is carried beside it through the derivative of the rising product. Two routes, at `N` and `2N`, share the powers. Each of the eight values, `zeta` and `zeta'` from each route, real and imaginary, is read toward zero: its sign times the floor of its size, the guard dropped. On the device `C` is carried at a fixed scale `S` as `tau_1 = s / 12N` and `tau_k = tau_(k-1) (s + 2k - 3)(s + 2k - 2) rho_k`, `rho_k = B_2k (2k - 2)! / (B_(2k-2) (2k)! N^2)`. Every term sits near the scale, each `tau` wrapped to a width from a bound on it. | `C` on the device for entry 6's triangle: `exact_zeta_tail.cu`, one lane a point, 35 steps a term, the shared record holding `S`, `S / 2` and every `rho_k S`. The head, `C'` and entry 4's walk stay on the host. | `B_2k / (2k)!` built once on the host and read by every lane as a table (M10's table). The head as an exact sum over a point's lanes. `C` and `C'` per point at the power-of-two width the record names, doubled where the value needs more: a lane too narrow refuses as a request error (M12) and never rounds. | `C` and `C'` measured on the host: about 340 bits at `N = 8`, about 2,160 at `N = 32`, and 6,733 to 6,871 at `N = 64` with `t` at sixteen places. Each takes the power-of-two width that holds it: 16 limbs, 512 bits, at `N = 8`; 128 limbs, 4,096 bits, at `N = 32`; and 256 limbs, 8,192 bits, at `N = 64`. The exact rational spends 98 percent of a value's time in gcd reductions, 3.5 of 3.57 seconds at `t = 190` and 21 places. On the device, at `N` from 1 to 64 over 128 points, the records equal the host's run of the same program word for word at every `N`, and `C` meets the exact rational at its own relative precision, 3 parts in `10^37` at `N = 64`. At `N = 64` the program is 2,224 steps in a file of 92 limbs, and 128 lanes sweep in 5.5 milliseconds once it is compiled; a launch costs about 0.4 seconds of its own. Fed by it, Euler-Maclaurin meets the host's to one unit at 21 places. | `C` built and run | the head's powers (Z2) in the same job, and both routes in one launch |
| **Z4. The point verdicts** | Four fields per point: `agree = NOT(Re one - Re two) NOT(Im one - Im two)`, and `COMPARE` of `Re zeta` with 0, of `Im zeta` with 0, and of `|Re zeta|` with `|Im zeta|`. A point is decided where the product of `agree` and the three absolute signs is nonzero. Its eighth of a turn is `2q + ((1 - sign_size) / 2 + q) % 2`, with `q = (1 - sign_im) + (1 - sign_re sign_im) / 2`. An undecided point is asked again at `places (1 + agree)` and `N (2 - agree)`. | On the host, in `Steering.sweep`. | A record per point, holding the point's two pairs, its places, `N`, the four values and the four verdicts, written by the sweep and read by the next. `COMPARE`, product and absolute are record operations (M10). The points asked again are compacted from the field `NOT(decided)` by a sum over it. | The run to `t = 123` writes 56,570 values, the deepest at sixteen places and the widest at `N = 64`. | host only | the record's layout, and the compaction as one sweep |
| **Z5. The edge verdicts** | Per half of an edge: `NOT(places_a - places_c)`, the chord `COMPARE(min(|zeta_a|^2, |zeta_c|^2), |zeta_c - zeta_a|^2)`, and at each end `COMPARE(|zeta|^2 10^(2q), |zeta'|^2 |c - a|^2)`. The turn from `a` to `c` is `(d_c - d_a + 4) % 8 - 4`, and the edge's turns read end to end and through the midpoint agree or not. A settled edge is the product of the positive verdicts. A negative verdict puts the midpoint into the path, a zero doubles the places, and unequal places ask both ends at the deeper. | On the host, in `Steering.count`. | One lane per half edge, reading the two point records at its ends. The places each point is asked at next, and the midpoints put into the path, written as fields and compacted by a sum over them. The turns summed per box, an exact sum over the box's lanes. | The quadrant alone counts `[24, 32]` and `[32, 40]` empty, and the chord alone counts `[98, 102]` empty (entry 4). With the step verdict every box below `t = 123` counts as the published table has it. | host only | the half edge as a record program reading two records |
| **Z6. The walk and the placing** | An empty box doubles the step, a box counting one is a zero, a crowded box splits into halves. Each zero is placed one bit per pass by the lower square centred on the line counting one. | On the host, in `Steering.walk` and `Steering.place`. | Nothing on the device past Z1 to Z5. The host reads the counts per box from the device and writes the next pass's boxes; each pass is one sweep of Z2 to Z5. | Forty zeros below `t = 123`, each placed by sixteen bits, each bracket holding the published ordinate: exit 0, five minutes on the host. | host only | the host loop over device passes |
| **Z7. The job** | One device, one daemon; a job declares its bytes, is admitted on its standing, and its peak is kept under its signum (M14). | The program runs on the host and asks the device nothing. | The program as a tessera job, beside the sims: `sim_job_submit` before its first device allocation and `sim_job_release` at its end. The signum is the host BLAKE3 of the program's name and arguments, the height and the bits. The declaration is the bytes of a pass, read from the records the last pass wrote: the points asked, times `2N` lanes, times the width at places plus the guard, and the records. Growth past it is told back, and the next run with the same signum is asked against the kept peak. | none | not built | the job's submit and release around the host loop, with the declaration read from the records |
| **Z8. The phase** | `theta(t)` by Stirling's series after a shift of `M`, two routes at `M = K = N` and `2N` (entry 5). Each `arg(1/4 + k + it/2)` is an arctangent of a rational by Euler's series and by the Taylor series about `1/2`, agreeing. The Gram index at a point is `theta` over pi, decided where `theta` reads strictly between `i pi` and `(i + 1) pi`. | On the host, in `exact_zeta_gram.py`, each `(p, q, digits)` arctangent asked once. | One lane per `(point, k)`, `k` below the shift, each an arctangent series run while its term is nonzero, as Z2's series run. The Stirling terms per point as Z3's tail is, from the same table of `B_2k / (2k)!`. The index and its two verdicts written to the point's record, and the midpoint's index read by the next pass to cut a bracket. | To `t = 285`, 5,198 values of `theta`, none deeper than eight places, none wider than `N = 4`. | host only | the arctangent series as a record program beside Z1's |
| **Z9. Riemann-Siegel** | `Z = 2 sum over n <= N of n^(-1/2) cos(theta - t ln n) + R`, with `t = 2pi u^4`, `N = floor(u^2)`, `p = u^2 - N`, and `R` from `c_0` to `c_5` (entry 6). `Psi` as two power series about `p`, its derivatives `r_j / d^(j+1)` by products, every term carried times `d^16 pi^10`. Across a cell, with `x = u^2 = nu + l / 2^b` and `z = 1 - 2p`, each `C_n(z)` is the sum over `j` of `g_(n,j) z^j`, read by Horner's rule, and over the common denominator `X^K`, `X = nu 2^b + l`, curve `n` of `R x^(1/2)` is the integer `s H_n 2^(b n) X^(K - n)` at its own binary exponent, `s = (-1)^(nu - 1)`. | `Z` on the host, in `exact_zeta_riemann_siegel.py`. The curves of `R`, `C_0` to `C_K`, on the device, in `exact_zeta_lobes.cu`'s curve stage, one lane a point of the cell: each value a mantissa in a register and a binary exponent the program holds, each `g_(n,j)` laid in the record `b (J_n - 1 - j)` bits up, and `nu` and the sign read from the record. | One lane per `(point, n)`, `n` up to `N`, each a Z2 power. The two series of `Psi` per point, sixteen coefficients each, as one record, and the `r_j` recurrence over it. The table of `c_k` read by every lane as Z3's Bernoulli table is. | To `t = 285`, 470 values of `Z`, the deepest at 64 places, the main sum at most six terms, the walk and the signs in seven seconds. Measured on the host at `u` = 1.2 and 2.6: the values take 138 to 195 bits at 1 to 8 places, 8 limbs, and 348 to 381 at 64 places, 16 limbs; their products take 391 to 517 bits, 16 or 32 limbs, and 1,019 to 1,075 at 64 places, 32 or 64 limbs. On the device at `nu` = 2 and 3, `b = 9`, `K = 3`, 513 lanes, the coefficients `g` at `2^-256`, 121 to 126 of them a curve: `R` meets the host's `remainder_at` to 60 places at every lane checked, and the host's run equals the device's word for word over 64 lanes. The stage is 1,504 steps, its lanes sweep in 4.6 milliseconds, and it compiles in about three minutes, kept: a second cell reuses it, `nu` being a field of the record. | `R`'s curves built and run; the main sum host only | the main sum per lane: its phase `2 pi x^2 (ln(nu / m) + A) - pi (x^2 + 1/8)` from Z1's `A`, and cos by the power series of that phase |
| **Z10. Turing's method** | `N(t) = theta(t) / pi + 1 + S(t)` off the ordinates, and for `t_2 > t_1 > 168 pi`, `|integral of S from t_1 to t_2| <= 2.067 + 0.059 log t_2` (Trudgian, Improvements to Turing's method, Math. Comp. 80 (2011), Theorem 2.2). On a lattice `t_i = 2 pi x_i^2`: a sign of `Z` is certified where `|Z| exceeds its bound`, and two certified points of opposite sign hold a zero between them. On `[t_i, t_(i+1)]`, `theta` lies between its values at the ends, since it increases, and the count of certified zeros past `T` is at most `N(t) - N(T)`. Integrating gives `N(T) <= 1 + (B + sum of dt_i (theta(t_(i+1)) / pi - c_i)) / H` over a window after `T` and `N(T) >= 1 + (sum of dt_i (d_(i+1) + theta(t_i) / pi) - B) / H` over a window before it, with `B` Trudgian's bound. Where `N(T_b) - N(T_a)` is at most the certified count between, every zero in `(T_a, T_b]` is a certified sign change: on the line, and simple. `Z = 2 sum over m <= nu of m^(-1/2) cos(theta - t ln m) + (-1)^(nu - 1) x^(-1/2) C_0 + E` with `|E| <= 0.127 t^(-3/4)` for `t >= 200` (Gabcke, as Hiary, Patel and Yang, An improved explicit estimate for zeta(1/2 + it), Lemma 2.1, state it), and `theta(t) = (t/2) log(t / (2 pi e)) - pi/8 + 1/(48 t) + E_theta` with `|E_theta| <= (7/5760 + pi/960) t^(-3) + exp(-pi t) / 2` (Brent, On asymptotic approximations to the log-Gamma and Riemann-Siegel theta functions, Theorems 5 and 6). | The pole, point, pair, verdict and count stages on the device, in `exact_zeta_turing.cu`, at `2^-62`, with the sums over each point's terms and over each cell's ranges by `cycle_record_sum`; the main sum by pairs or by the multiple evaluation of Odlyzko and Schonhage, whose leaf multipoles, shifts up, across and down, near field, evaluation and transform are ten more stages; below `168 pi`, `Z` by Euler-Maclaurin, whose tail `N^(-s) C` is one more stage; the machine one level up in `exact_zeta_turing.py`, which joins each cell's sums to its neighbors', holds `N` at every cell, and refines a cell that falls short. | The automata, each fixed in width and checked against the host word for word: `ln k` and `k^(-1/2)` once a pole; `theta / pi` and `(-1)^(nu - 1) x^(-1/2) C_0` once a point; `k^(-1/2) cos(phi_k)` a pair, read through the index; the certified sign and the stepped brackets of `theta / pi` a point; the zeros a point. The machine one level up runs them cell by cell, joins the cells' sums into the two integrals over the lattice, and halts with the count proven, or runs a cell again on a finer lattice where a count does not close. | Over cells 10 to 300, on a lattice even in `t` with 4 points or more a zero and two rounds four times finer where a count falls short, every zero in `(760.265422, 565486.677646]` is a certified sign change, 936,221 of them, with `N` held to one value at both ends and every port check equal, in 939 seconds (entry 9). By the multiple evaluation, cells 10 to 127 give the same 139,676 zeros and the same `N`, its `Z` within `1.3 e-15` of the pairs' on cells 10 to 12, and a cell at `nu = 3,000` in 5.6 seconds against 12.6 by pairs. Below, by Euler-Maclaurin and Johansson's bound on its remainder, which holds at every `t`, cells 1 to 10 give 460 certified sign changes in `(6.283185, 760.265422]`, all of `N(760.265422)`, in 305 seconds (entry 14). Above, cells 299 to 1001 by the multiple evaluation, each on the lattice of least expected cost to close and every width set from the input, give every zero in `(565486.677646, 6295757.960979]` as a certified sign change, 11,906,477, with `N(6295757.960979) = 12,843,158`, in 3,840 seconds and four rounds (entry 15). | built and run, three ways | the lattice even in `theta / pi`; the form factor of the certified zeros on it |
| **Z12. The slope** | `F' = sum over k of -i ln k k^(-1/2) exp(-i t ln k)`: the multiple evaluation over the poles weighted by `-i ln k / 2^c`, `2^c >= ln nu`, gives `F' / 2^c`. `Z' = 2 (Re(exp(i theta) F') - theta' Im(exp(i theta) F))`, `theta' = ln s / 2` within `1 / (48 t^2)`. By pairs, `Z' = 2 (sum of k^(-1/2) ln k sin(phi) - theta' sum of k^(-1/2) sin(phi))`. | The weighted pole stage, a second multiple evaluation, the twist and slope stages, in `exact_zeta_turing.cu` with the listing word 2; at listed points the pair stage's two sine sums. | `F` and `F'` from one multiple evaluation, each expansion carrying both charge sets over one tree, one index and one set of twiddles; the weighted poles from the first pole records. | The two `Z'` differ by `5.9 e-12` at most over cell 300 against bounds summing to `5.5 e-7` (entry 16). The twist's evaluation takes 1.43 s of a cell's run at `2^15`, its programs loaded again. As two sets of one evaluation, a cell at `2^15` takes 0.33 to 0.39 s inside the binary, every output equal to the two evaluations' (entry 17). | built and run, `F` and `F'` as two sets of one evaluation | the weighted poles from the first pole records |
| **Z13. The margin** | The cubic `C` through `Z` and `Z'` at a step's ends lies in the hull of `z0, z0 + (h / 3) z0', z1 - (h / 3) z1', z1`; `|M - C_M| <= h^4 / 384 max |M''''|`, and with the bounds on `Z`, `Z'` and `R'` the margin: a step whose hull clears it holds no zero. `|M' - C_M'| <= (2 / 81) h^3 max |M''''|` by Rolle's theorem, and a crossing whose slope's three Bernstein points clear the steepness is single. | The margin stage, one lane a step, on every run with the listing word 2; `refine` lists again only the runs it cannot close, eight times finer, to three levels; `refine check` the crossings too. | The rate of the coarse lattice chosen as a cost, its points against the steps the margin flags; the band within the bound on `Z` about a crossing, where `Zh`'s monotony says nothing of `Z`'s, closed by a bound on `Z`'s own slope. | Cells 300 to 309: 25,865 clean, 6,573 single and 329 flagged over cell 300; 55,830 certified at round 0 with no rerun, in 67 s; with `check`, 98 s and no crossing holding three zeros (entry 16). | built and run | the rate as a cost (Z14) |
| **Z14. The run** | The programs depend on the widths alone, set from `nu`'s bits, `s`'s, `p` and `beta`; `nu`, `2 nu + 1` and `2 nu^2` are parameters. Across a cell `s = nu^2 (1 + e)`, `e < 3 / nu`, and `ln s`, `x` and `x^(-1/2)` are series in `e` over the cell's constants `ln nu`, `nu` and `nu^(-1/2)`. | One process for every cell and refine pass, `exact_zeta_turing serve`, each program loaded once under its steps, fields, members and outputs, and the host's checks on threads beside the device over the records their lanes read, in parts; the margin's bound once a `nu`; the point stage's `ln s` over 33 folds and 21 terms and two Newton roots from folded seeds | The point stage's logarithm and roots as series in `e`; the coarse rate from the cost with the margin's flags. | `seconds` over cell 300 at `2^15` with `F'`: 4.98 s inside, 3.35 s loading the programs onto the device, 0.02 s of it the imprint and layout, 0.67 s the host's checks, the rest 0.96 s. Cell 1000 at `2^17`: 3.81, 2.43, 0.61 and 0.77 s. 600 listed points by pairs, 2.32 s. The margin's bound, 0.15 s at `nu = 300` and 1.25 s at `nu = 1000` a call. In one process: cells 301 to 305 load no program and take 1.07 to 1.86 s inside, 0.69 to 1.31 s of it the host's checks; `refine` over cells 300 to 309, 34 s against 67 s, the same 55,830 zeros. With the checks beside the device, cells 301 to 305 take 0.58 to 0.64 s inside and `refine` over cells 300 to 309 28 s. With the checks in parts on half the cores and the margin's bound kept for each `nu`, 600 listed points take 0.23 s and `refine` over cells 300 to 309 14 s (entry 17). | one process, the checks beside the device and the bound once a `nu` built and run | the point stage's logarithm and roots as series in `e` |
| **Z11. Harish-Chandra's spherical function** | `phi_r = 2F1(1/2 + i r, 1/2 - i r; 1; -u)`, `u = sinh^2(d / 2)`, the radial eigenfunction of the Laplacian on `H = SL(2, R) / SO(2)` with eigenvalue `-(1/4 + r^2)`, 1 at its center. By Pfaff, `phi_r = (1 + u)^(-1/2) exp(-i r ln(1 + u)) 2F1(1/2 + i r, 1/2 + i r; 1; u / (1 + u))`. On the modular surface `SL(2, Z)\H`, the Selberg transform `h(r)` of a kernel `k(u)` is the integral of `k` against `phi_r`; for large `d`, `phi_r` is `c(r) e^((i r - 1/2) d) + c(-r) e^((-i r - 1/2) d)` with `c(r) = Gamma(i r) / (sqrt(pi) Gamma(1/2 + i r))`; and the cusp's scattering is `phi(1/2 + i r) = pi c(r) zeta(2 i r) / zeta(1 + 2 i r)`, with a pole at `s = rho / 2` for every non-trivial zero `rho`. | Both routes on the device, in `exact_zeta_spherical.cu`, one lane a point `(r, u)` of a grid, at `2^-62`, each route's term count and error bound from `bounds` in `exact_zeta_spherical.py` at the grid's far corner. | `phi_r` at every `(r, u)` a kernel asks, each route bounded and the two agreeing; then `h(r)` for a kernel `k` by an exact quadrature in `u` over the lanes, summed by `cycle_record_sum`; `c(r)` by Stirling's series for `Gamma`, the large-`d` side of `phi_r`; and the Eisenstein constant term through `c(r)` and zeta at `2 i r` and `1 + 2 i r`. | On `r` in `[0, 8)` by `1/8` and `u` in `[0, 1/2)` by `1/128`, 4,096 lanes in one program of 4,924 steps: the routes differ by `6.288 e-18` at most within `2.193 e-11`, route two's imaginary part is `5.638 e-18` at most, `phi_r = 1` at `u = 0`, the exact rational series meets the device within `7 e-19` at four points, and the host's records equal the device's (entry 10). | `phi_r` built and run | the Selberg transform of a kernel over the lanes; `u` past 1, where route one no longer converges and route two carries it; `c(r)` and the scattering through zeta |

## Open, not done

- Entry 4 counts below `t = 123`, one value at a time on the host, in five minutes. The device
  program and its wants are the table above. Of it, Z3's `C` and Z1's `A` across a cell run on the
  device; the rest is not built.
- Entry 5 reads `theta` and the Gram points on the host, and Z8 above is its device part, not built.
- Entry 6 reads `Z` on the host. Of Z9, its device part, `R`'s curves run across a cell, and entry
  9's term and point stages give `Z` through `C_0` at every point of a cell. Every `C_n` is built
  (entry 7), and `R` still stops at `c_5`: `R` to the series' own least term, and the exact remainder
  in place of the series, are wanted, not built.
- Entry 7's zeros of `C_n` are read on grids, and a count proven complete on `0 < z < 1` is wanted,
  not built. What grows in triangle cell 5, six times cell 4's time, is not yet read.
- Asked of the triangle: the fractal has at least three terms and perhaps five, perhaps all of x, y,
  z, d and t. It then becomes a probability wave function, and a vector walk over it proves the
  fractal. Then: it is a coordinate system, a dimension and time. Entry 8
  reads them as the three sides, each side's scaling exponent between cells, and `t`. The vector walk
  over them is wanted, not built.
- Entry 8's spread of the arrival angles is read in four windows of 1,024 boundaries. More windows,
  and whole stretches of boundaries, are wanted. The triangle measured past cell 6, against what the
  omitted curves give there, is wanted.
- Computing `zeta(s)` in the critical strip needs complex arithmetic and an accelerated method,
  Riemann-Siegel or Euler-Maclaurin. Entry 4 uses Euler-Maclaurin across the strip, and entry 6
  Riemann-Siegel on the line. Riemann-Siegel off the line, for entry 4's boxes, is not built.
  A computation there is a numerical observation at the places it reads, never a statement about all
  zeros.
- Whether a non-trivial zero has a closed form in the constructors is a separate question from where
  it sits, and it is not addressed here.
- Entries 9, 14 and 15 verify `(0, 6295757.960979]`. Cells past 1001 are a field of the same run.
- The lattice even in `theta / pi`, the form factor of the certified zeros on it, its ramp from `F`'s
  primes and its plateau from the zeros, at each e-fold height, are wanted, not built. Each pair's
  difference carries the two certified intervals' widths, and the lattice is finer than the spacing
  the form factor resolves.
- The drawn null through the same field, GUE draws in place of the zeros or the carrier's phase
  shuffled, against every structure entry 16 reads, is wanted, not built.
- The metallic carriers in place of e ("The zeros in the engine's field", (6)): the golden `1, 1, 1`,
  the silver `2, 2, 2` and the `1, 1, 2` comb, the lattices they step, the moments of `w` against each,
  their beat as the difference, and the shuffled steps as the null, are wanted, not built. Every growth
  constant, `phi`, `1 + sqrt(2)` and `3 + sqrt(10)`, is a Pisot unit, and each comb is a
  one-dimensional Pisot quasicrystal ([zeta_prior_art.md](zeta_prior_art.md)).
- The two crystals tuned to a known comb and set against each other ("The zeros in the engine's field",
  (7)): reading `w` and its conjugate against a chosen carrier with a drawn null is wanted, not built.
  The prior art, the
  explicit formula as a pairing and Weil positivity, is in [zeta_prior_art.md](zeta_prior_art.md).
- Entry 16's rows under us, the far misses and the separation are built and not yet run. Nine e-folds,
  from which a slow law in the drifting rows can be told from noise, are wanted.
- The bounds charge an error `delta` in `theta` at first order, and `Z` moves by `Z (cos(delta) - 1)`,
  second order (entry 14). A bound that charges `|Z| delta^2 / 2` is wanted, not written.
- Entry 10 reads `phi_r` for `u < 1/2` and `r < 8`. The Selberg transform of a kernel, `c(r)`, and
  the scattering `pi c(r) zeta(2 i r) / zeta(1 + 2 i r)`, whose poles sit at half the zeros, are
  wanted, not built.

## Withdrawn

Nothing withdrawn yet. The rail keeps this heading, and a later reader knows a pulled claim would
appear here with what killed it, instead of vanishing.
